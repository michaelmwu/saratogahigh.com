That also meant that you can see 7+ shows going on at the same time, which was really cool. It ended too soon though, mostly because my dad and I were wandering about confused previously.

Thank you soooo much everyone! Kathleen for the cake and dessert, a lot of you guys apparently for the Gamecube, Vicky for the dessert, Wendy for the pie, Matt for the books (especially the North Beach Diet, LOL), David for another book, Darren for a gift certificate, and Christine for the IOU, haha. I'm still really really impressed that you guys gave me a Gamecube... are you trying to make my productivity go down to 0 again? :P Hahaha just kidding, thank you very, very much.<br /><br />We played some SSBM in the beginning, then Bridge and Napoleon and Mahjong. Anderthan, Bryant, Ninad, and I tried to start some water rugby, but not enough people wanted to play, so we swam around, then we tried to throw Henry in the pool, but that failed. And HAH Anderthan, you AREN'T 150 lbs. Went back to more games, Mario Tennis, and cards, etc... Haha, I saw that Scott and Allison were playing CS a lot of the time, and now Allison is addicted, hahaha. Around 5, Wendy and Allison left for dance, and we played a bit more until we went off to the Elephant Bar, where DARREN showed up, and I also got a cool dessert from Vicky and Kathleen.<br /><br />After that, we went off to Homestead Lanes to play pool, cards, and go bowl. HAHA we are SO BAD at bowling, oh man... Bryant was a monster the first game, then he sucked the second. I ended up with 92 and probably would have broken 100 on the second, but we were kicked off. Uhh.. and uhh nice soda mixture we got, haha. Oh mannn I feel so bad because we didn't go back earlier, otherwise Tiffany and Elaine would have come. Instead, they said screw it at 10:00. But apparently Susan stopped by and we weren't here, but I got her to come anyways afterwards. Kathleen got dropped off at home, and Robbie popped up around 10:10 or so. We watched Memento then and Team America. Memento... makes my head hurts.. but less than it does right now. Team America was hella funny. AMERICA, FUCK YEA! Hahhahahaha. Anyways, we played Smash and Tennis and other crap until 3, then we attempted to sleep, but instead ended up playing Contact for 2 hours until 5. There was also a separate room that I had no idea what they were doing... buttsex? I dunno. LOL. Well, we eventually all went to sleep.<br /><br />Someone left a pair of glasses at my house.. who does it belong to?<br /><br />Next day, woke up, played more games with the people, ate breakfast, and then about 11:20 or so, everyone left, as we had a concert to attend. Ugh.. cell phone was out of batteries and mom was at Safeway, so I was rushing all around, and also had to steal my dad's cell. Which I promptly then left in my car as soon as we left the school. The concert started out with some so so bands, so we decided to go instead play frisbee, then walk off to Subway to eat lunch. We came back, checked out Tragedy Andy and 5606, who were pretty good. Unfortunately, a mosh pit / fight started, and dust was everywhere, so I kinda left to watch at a distance, then grabbed a free cd, then left again. Wendy and David showed up with a huge picnic, and that was pretty cool.<br /><br />Bowling for Soup was pretty good. Very fun and exciting, and good music too. Oh, beer drinking while playing, and calling the audience really hot very frequently. Hahahaha. Mmm... we hung out after their bit.. played Frisbee, ate shaved ice (thanks Kat!), etc.. Then Crossfade came on, and I didn't really like them, so we wandered off to go throw stuff around and lay down. Then Kat and Darren and Vicky disappeared, so Jeff and I went to go look for them. Vicky, Henry, Jason, Kat, and Darren decided to go off and eat dinner, then go home, because they were partial on Better than Ezra. BUT YOU GUYS TOTALLY MISSED OUT. Crossfade finished off with Cold, which was pretty good, then it took a while for Better Than Ezra to get started. After 2 or so songs, Better Than Ezra did was to tell us all to jump the barrier and get up RIGHT next to the stage. Woot! Next, while playing, they started throwing guitar picks out to everyone. I think someone stuck their bra onto stage, and BTE made a big deal out of it (in a good meaning though), and tied it up for public display, hahaha. After a while, they got a guy to come up on stage and play the cowbell while doing totally random things while running around stage. Hahhaha... so very amusing. Good songs, right next to stage, complete amusement, free picks.. yea.. you guys missed out. I didn't get any picks though, so poo.. but Ninad, Jin, Jeff, and plenty of other Saratoga people did. We stole a bunch of signs from the event; I ripped one straight off, breaking the zip ties, woot. We stopped by Donut Wheel afterwards, then dropped me at the school, where I conveniently found my cell phone in my car.. oops. Ninad and Jin stopped by my house to pick up a Xbox and Ninad's sleeping bag. Oh.. and Darren and I were supposed to go to a dinner party, supposedly very important, but we kinda.. skipped that because of the lack of rides. Heh.. oops.<br /><br />Oh jeez, now I am really really dead.. ears hurt, tired from no sleep, hungry...

Thank you soooo much everyone! Kathleen for the cake and dessert, a lot of you guys apparently for the Gamecube, Vicky for the dessert, Wendy for the pie, Matt for the books (especially the North Beach Diet, LOL), David for another book, Darren for a gift certificate, and Christine for the IOU, haha. I'm still really really impressed that you guys gave me a Gamecube... are you trying to make my productivity go down to 0 again? :P Hahaha just kidding, thank you very, very much.<br /><br />We played some SSBM in the beginning, then Bridge and Napoleon and Mahjong. Anderthan, Bryant, Ninad, and I tried to start some water rugby, but not enough people wanted to play, so we swam around, then we tried to throw Henry in the pool, but that failed. And HAH Anderthan, you AREN'T 150 lbs. Went back to more games, Mario Tennis, and cards, etc... Haha, I saw that Scott and Allison were playing CS a lot of the time, and now Allison is addicted, hahaha. Around 5, Wendy and Allison left for dance, and we played a bit more until we went off to the Elephant Bar, where DARREN showed up, and I also got a cool dessert from Vicky and Kathleen.<br /><br />After that, we went off to Homestead Lanes to play pool, cards, and go bowl.

It's okay, we dominated Wendy and Ninad anyways :P.<br /><br />So anyways, I stopped by the LAN yesterday at Bryant's house to play uh Yahoo Games.

I went to Barnes and Noble after that to get the Lang readings - Sophie's World and The Elements of Style.

We ran to Jin's house, then Kathleen's house. Kathleen decided to randomly join us, so we went running off to Jin's house because Kathleen had never been there before. Yes, in retrospect, that was a problem, because we were led off in a wild goose chase off somewhere in Campbell, but found his house anyways. Ping Pong! Yes! Haha. Anyways, dear father Jin drove the pooped out Wendy and Kathleen back to Kathleen's house, then Wendy to my house. We love dear father Jin :). Wendy and I ran.. approximately 4.5 miles that day? Yawn.. that was easy; we should go running again sometime! :) I should also get a YMCA membership so I can work out with Jin, haha.<br /><br />High quality photo scanning is hard work!

No, actually it's going to be really weird. Hm. Also, I'll have to drive my sister to school everyday, which is good because it means I can drive everyday next year. The bad part is that she is already good at making her Redwood carpool late EVERY SINGLE DAY, and they leave at 7:50. I'm either screwed, or I'll have to ditch my sister everyday until she learns not to be late. Ugh.<br /><br />I need to pack for Chawanakee tomorrow... seriously. Yawn.

No, actually it's going to be really weird. Hm. Also, I'll have to drive my sister to school everyday, which is good because it means I can drive everyday next year. The bad part is that she is already good at making her Redwood carpool late EVERY SINGLE DAY, and they leave at 7:50. I'm either screwed, or I'll have to ditch my sister everyday until she learns not to be late. Ugh.<br /><br />I need to pack for Chawanakee tomorrow... seriously. Yawn. And what's with the random stack of college mail? It also seems I'm tutoring my neighbor at Bio over the summer? Hmm. So anyways, I'll be gone for a week, so see you all later! Wow..

Help is appreciated!<br /><br />Anyways.... well, our calculus project succeeded in exploding everyone in the room's brains. If you want to take a gander and explode your brain also, you can go <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surreal_number">here</a>. Very interesting. Well, after school, uhh.. William, Matthew, and I went to Sacred Heart for Spanish community service. And obviously, William and Matthew were magically transported there *cough* over 20 minutes of highway and such *cough* while I obviously drove alone *cough*. I seem to have a bad cough, I might need a glass of water. ;). Those homeless people are silly. They have better junk food than my house does. Sigh.<br /><br />We found Ravi there, so that William and Matthew were not *magically transporting* again, and instead were brought home by Ravi's mom. I don't even know why I followed her on the highway. I could have gotten back fine, but she took weird turns and ended up farther than where we wanted to be, and then got stuck in traffic. I refused to use the carpool lane and was then subsequently stuck, and extremely late for the Shrek 2 in Spanish. OMG that movie is hilarious, haha. Especially in Spanish. Spanish makes ANY movie funny, even more so with Disney. Afterwards, I went off to Wendy's house to go bake for Senior Slave Day and check out her costumes. I baked: apple crunch, and triple chocolate brownies. She did the double chocolate chip cookies. I chose out the fertility goddess costume ;). Oh man my mom was terribly mad at me for uhh.. not appearing at home until 11:00. Oops.<br /><br />Actually, here are the recipes for the triple chocolate brownies and apple crisp. Mmmm. So I *can* bake pastries okay, haha.<br /><br />Apple Crunch (I took this out of the 50's cookbook Grenier gave me)<br /><br />3 pounds cooking apples (McIntosh are fine)<br />1 cup flour<br />1/2 cup sugar<br />1/2 cup (1 stick butter)<br />Nutmeg<br />Cinnamon<br /><br />Peel, core, and slice apples and place in a buttered baking dish. Mix flour and sugar well. Mix them to a paste with the butter. Spread over the top of the appels. Sprinkle with nutmeg and cinnamon. Bake in 375 degree oven 35 minutes. Serve with whipped cream if desired.<br /><br />Triple Chocolate Brownies (Previously known as Goop, now known as extremely good)<br /><br />Brownies:<br />1/3 cup butter<br />3 squares unsweetened chocolate<br />2/3 cup flour<br />1/2 teaspoon baking powder<br />1/4 teaspoon salt<br />2 eggs<br />3/4 cup sugar<br />1 teaspoon vanilla<br />1 cup white chocolate chips<br /><br />Icing:<br />4 oz. milk chocolate<br />3 tablespoons butter<br /><br />Directions:<br /><br />Brownies:<br />Melt butter and chocolate together. Set aside to cool.<br /><br />In a small bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt.<br /><br />In a large bowl beat eggs. Blend in sugar. Add chocolate mixture and vanilla. Stir in flour mixture, and white chocolate chips.<br /><br />Pour into a greased 8 inch square pan. Bake at 325 degrees F. for 18 to 20 minutes. Cool.<br /><br />Icing:<br />Melt milk chocolate and butter together.<br /><br />Spread over the cooled cake. Cool and cut into squares. Store in refrigerator.<br /><br />I burned a Britney + other songs mix to blast with a boombox, but unfortunately, I was unable to find a boombox that worked and that I had enough batteries for. Darn. So I basically made Wendy twirl around a bit, carry some of my stuff, and buy me Quiznos. Mmm Steakhouse Beef Dip :). I didn't really care that you didn't really do anything super embarrassing. Baked goods is good enough, haha. Oh man some of the other slaves, I feel so very sorry for them. Went home.. and wow it was so very hot. Ohman.<br /><br />Thursday, well, was a normal day. In APUS, I called in my neighbor, and Arvind called in another WWII veteran, to talk about their experiences in WWII. It was really awesome and informative. We did tape it too. Maybe if we transfer it to VHS or DVD form, we can make Anzalone's class watch too, bwahaha. I saw this in the Tech Room:<br /><br />Apparently I've been prebanned from the sofa. Ohwell, I deserve it. So the story is.. freshman year? the Tech room had a sofa. It was nice. So anyways, over Winter Break, I left a Thermos full of beef stew on the sofa. When we came back, the sofa was covered in mold and we had to throw it out. So to Ms. Grenier and her crew and family, I am Beef Stew Michael Wu (it rhymes!), besides being a TA. Heh. I'm so very good. I went home, and did some Spanish filming. Look, it's me in uhh Don Quixote armor! Aren't I just so.. interesting?<br /><br />Banned!<br /><img src="http://omega.digitalitcc.com/~icy/banned.jpg" width="90%" height="90%"><br /><br />Look!

Pounce pounce pounce. I ditched Stats for Torrens then ditched Torrens for Physics. Hehhe. Afterwards, I dropped off receipts at Argonaut, then I went to get plants for my Eagle Project, and then came back home to study for SATs and do Kat's yearbook. I dropped off Knoppix at Ninad's house, came back, finished Kat's yearbook, then seeing as she was asleep, drove by at 10:30 and stuck it on your doormat. I assume you got it okay. Heh. Enjoy!

Help is appreciated!<br /><br />Anyways.... well, our calculus project succeeded in exploding everyone in the room's brains. If you want to take a gander and explode your brain also, you can go <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surreal_number">here</a>. Very interesting. Well, after school, uhh.. William, Matthew, and I went to Sacred Heart for Spanish community service. And obviously, William and Matthew were magically transported there *cough* over 20 minutes of highway and such *cough* while I obviously drove alone *cough*. I seem to have a bad cough, I might need a glass of water. ;). Those homeless people are silly. They have better junk food than my house does. Sigh.<br /><br />We found Ravi there, so that William and Matthew were not *magically transporting* again, and instead were brought home by Ravi's mom. I don't even know why I followed her on the highway. I could have gotten back fine, but she took weird turns and ended up farther than where we wanted to be, and then got stuck in traffic. I refused to use the carpool lane and was then subsequently stuck, and extremely late for the Shrek 2 in Spanish. OMG that movie is hilarious, haha. Especially in Spanish. Spanish makes ANY movie funny, even more so with Disney. Afterwards, I went off to Wendy's house to go bake for Senior Slave Day and check out her costumes. I baked: apple crunch, and triple chocolate brownies. She did the double chocolate chip cookies. I chose out the fertility goddess costume ;). Oh man my mom was terribly mad at me for uhh.. not appearing at home until 11:00. Oops.<br /><br />Actually, here are the recipes for the triple chocolate brownies and apple crisp. Mmmm. So I *can* bake pastries okay, haha.<br /><br />Apple Crunch (I took this out of the 50's cookbook Grenier gave me)<br /><br />3 pounds cooking apples (McIntosh are fine)<br />1 cup flour<br />1/2 cup sugar<br />1/2 cup (1 stick butter)<br />Nutmeg<br />Cinnamon<br /><br />Peel, core, and slice apples and place in a buttered baking dish. Mix flour and sugar well. Mix them to a paste with the butter. Spread over the top of the appels. Sprinkle with nutmeg and cinnamon. Bake in 375 degree oven 35 minutes. Serve with whipped cream if desired.<br /><br />Triple Chocolate Brownies (Previously known as Goop, now known as extremely good)<br /><br />Brownies:<br />1/3 cup butter<br />3 squares unsweetened chocolate<br />2/3 cup flour<br />1/2 teaspoon baking powder<br />1/4 teaspoon salt<br />2 eggs<br />3/4 cup sugar<br />1 teaspoon vanilla<br />1 cup white chocolate chips<br /><br />Icing:<br />4 oz. milk chocolate<br />3 tablespoons butter<br /><br />Directions:<br /><br />Brownies:<br />Melt butter and chocolate together. Set aside to cool.<br /><br />In a small bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt.<br /><br />In a large bowl beat eggs. Blend in sugar. Add chocolate mixture and vanilla. Stir in flour mixture, and white chocolate chips.<br /><br />Pour into a greased 8 inch square pan. Bake at 325 degrees F. for 18 to 20 minutes. Cool.<br /><br />Icing:<br />Melt milk chocolate and butter together.<br /><br />Spread over the cooled cake. Cool and cut into squares. Store in refrigerator.<br /><br />I burned a Britney + other songs mix to blast with a boombox, but unfortunately, I was unable to find a boombox that worked and that I had enough batteries for. Darn. So I basically made Wendy twirl around a bit, carry some of my stuff, and buy me Quiznos. Mmm Steakhouse Beef Dip :). I didn't really care that you didn't really do anything super embarrassing. Baked goods is good enough, haha. Oh man some of the other slaves, I feel so very sorry for them. Went home.. and wow it was so very hot. Ohman.<br /><br />Thursday, well, was a normal day. In APUS, I called in my neighbor, and Arvind called in another WWII veteran, to talk about their experiences in WWII. It was really awesome and informative. We did tape it too. Maybe if we transfer it to VHS or DVD form, we can make Anzalone's class watch too, bwahaha. I saw this in the Tech Room:<br /><br />Apparently I've been prebanned from the sofa. Ohwell, I deserve it. So the story is.. freshman year? the Tech room had a sofa. It was nice. So anyways, over Winter Break, I left a Thermos full of beef stew on the sofa. When we came back, the sofa was covered in mold and we had to throw it out. So to Ms. Grenier and her crew and family, I am Beef Stew Michael Wu (it rhymes!), besides being a TA. Heh. I'm so very good. I went home, and did some Spanish filming. Look, it's me in uhh Don Quixote armor! Aren't I just so.. interesting?<br /><br />Banned!<br /><img src="http://omega.digitalitcc.com/~icy/banned.jpg" width="90%" height="90%"><br /><br />Look! I look like an idiot!<br /><img src="http://omega.digitalitcc.com/~icy/aluminum.jpg"><br /><br />I ran to Home Depot to get wood, and also my cousin's house to get photo paper. <strike>So now I have Kat's autograph page, but unfortunately, I DON'T have the full face tongue sticking out photo. I think Ninad has it? Kathleen, do you mind if I steal your page for one more day? I can return it to you over the weekend if you wish.</strike><br /><br />Cough, well, Friday was interesting. Pounce pounce pounce. I ditched Stats for Torrens then ditched Torrens for Physics. Hehhe.

Then at 2 or so, 3 people called to say they wanted to help, except for that I ALREADY STOPPED. Ohwell. I then went to do community service at the Saratoga History Museum, the one that no one goes to, dragging along David and Henry too.

Wheee..<br /><br />Darren is so cool for the following reasons:<br /><br />1.) Uh, well, he 0wns a portion of my science/math soul. Which has been thought of as stock before. And since people need to have confident in their stock, I should be happy for him. Haha. By the way, my stock went up $10 since it's the start of a new semester. Congrats. :P<br /><br />2.) Even though he lives in a small, un-remodeled and cramped room at school, known as the Tech Room, he still ventures outside to help those in need (me) and objects in need of assistance (jroom computers).<br /><br />3.) Superficially, he writes cool, yet somewhat nerdy, puns on the jroom board. Sadly it took me a while to get the one about the man in the sun becoming a TANGENT. Gah, so nerdy, but so funny. And how his lj sn is dare onion. It took me a while because that seemed to be the weirdest combo of names ever. Until I realized the intricate quirkiness/uniqueness of it. Haha.<br /><br />4.)

And since people need to have confident in their stock, I should be happy for him. Haha. By the way, my stock went up $10 since it's the start of a new semester. Congrats. :P<br /><br />2.) Even though he lives in a small, un-remodeled and cramped room at school, known as the Tech Room, he still ventures outside to help those in need (me) and objects in need of assistance (jroom computers).<br /><br />3.) Superficially, he writes cool, yet somewhat nerdy, puns on the jroom board. Sadly it took me a while to get the one about the man in the sun becoming a TANGENT. Gah, so nerdy, but so funny. And how his lj sn is dare onion. It took me a while because that seemed to be the weirdest combo of names ever. Until I realized the intricate quirkiness/uniqueness of it. Haha.<br /><br />4.) He makes me laugh. Like the APUS seat everyday and how we fight for it. One time we sat in the same chair for 10 minutes before Anzalone forced one of us to take the seat right next to it--all the while we were laughing at each other. In the end, I moved. &gt;:[ But it was still funny.<br /><br />5.) Crossword puzzles in APUS. We're not bad children! Really! Anzalone just likes to take it away or yell at us to put it away a lot. It's especially amusing when I start a whole crossword by myself (a rare occasion nowadays, stupid jroom and not getting the ENT section...) and I fill it in with what I think is right. Then Darren gets to burst my bubble by telling me all of them are wrong. Like on Friday. Oh, but I did get "Liu" right for Lucy in Charlie's Angel. Haha.<br /><br />6.) He hangs out with everyone and that makes me feel special. Unlike me. I'm in my little journalism bubble or the bubble with my friends. Or choir. <br /><br />7.) He's wayyyy too smart for his own good. But luckily he doesn't hoard his intelligence and plan to build a machine to suck more intelligence from Nobel Prize winners (don't ask, it was on a show) because he willingly gives it away to people! YAY! And whatever he does, he 0wns at. Stupid natural talent. :P<br /><br />8.) He doesn't believe in inferiority. Or well, he doesn't look down on people and I respect that a lot. Or stereotype. Like, "Oh, since he takes remedial science and smokes in the teacher's lounge, he's a dumbass compared to me" kind of idea.<br /><br />9.) He listens a lot. Like me, who rants a lot about nonsense. Ah, and the old saying goes true. Better to leave everyone in doubt that you are a fool or open your mouth and remove all doubt. Something like that. Yes, I just called myself a fool.

Repeating your points over and over doesn't really help, y'know, only makes your speech more boring. I wonder how the councillors stand it all the time. Isn't it slightly boring to sit there all the time, listening to people blab on and on and on and on and a few more ons? Or maybe they take great delight in watching Gov students suffer and die in the back, attempting not to keel over and sleep. I know I almost did. I don't think a job as a politician attracts me too much, besides the becoming a slimey weasel part!<br /><br />And no David, the councillors != teh sexay. Well maybe Norman is a bit ;)<br /><br />Well, Gov was awesome earlier today for not existing. We woke up bright and early and got to De Anza, only to find a nice sign tacked on the door saying 'No Class Today.' So instead, Ninad, Henry, and I popped over to my house to play GC, of course. I'm absolutely terrible compared to Henry, game monster prime.<br /><br />After lunch, popped over to the SHroom to do work. Classifieds is BACK! IN BLACK! Errr... well it is looking spiffier than ever, haha, but you guys won't see that until school starts. You can now upload your own pictures :D. And unfortunately enough, the random picture I chose to test it with was of a rabbit humping a chicken. You really don't want to know. *IMMEDIATE DELETE* I'm also porting over a new code system, woohoo! Phil popped up too to print out some stuff and do other stuff. I also grabbed my transcript to apply for a $100 scholarship for being in a fashion show and doing some other Relay For Life. Hahaha, yes, I shall be a model along with Darren and Wendy, and possibly some of the people who my mom randomly enticed when they were over. Woot.<br /><br />I just finished watching Pitch Black, a movie suggested by some counselor at boy scout camp. It's based off Isaac Asimov's Nightfall, but really isn't anything like it. She kinda is a big Vin Diesel fan *blink blink*, considering she suggested A Man Apart, Pitch Black, The Pacifier, and The Chronicles of Riddick. Derr.. she totally described it wrong, and instead described the book as the movie. Bad counselor.<br /><br />On Tuesday, after sitting through another exciting session of gov (no sarcasm indeed), I downloaded more crap until 3:30, then I popped over to Darren's house for my uh.. very first guitar lesson! Wooohooo! I are teh utter noob. I uh.. did a scale and some chords. Yay. Darren played along with Love Me Do, or at least tried. I like the teacher, she is pretty nice and good I think. Well I really don't know what I am talking about. It's okay though, everyone starts out that way, hahaha. And uh.. I have no idea how my parents lost a guitar in my own house. I think I can borrow my cousin's then and replace the strings. And then randomly, I got asked to stay for dinner, and so I ended up hanging out at Darren's house until 11 or so. Woohoo! I uhh practiced a bit more in that time and also stole some C++ books. Darren suggests the USACO, and I think I will do it. Yay. Programming is teh fun. I seem to have about 3 possibly software / tech jobs lined up for me next summer O_o. I'm wanted, haha.<br /><br />EDIT: Hey, I found the start of my other entry.

I don't think a job as a politician attracts me too much, besides the becoming a slimey weasel part!<br /><br />And no David, the councillors != teh sexay. Well maybe Norman is a bit ;)<br /><br />Well, Gov was awesome earlier today for not existing. We woke up bright and early and got to De Anza, only to find a nice sign tacked on the door saying 'No Class Today.' So instead, Ninad, Henry, and I popped over to my house to play GC, of course. I'm absolutely terrible compared to Henry, game monster prime.<br /><br />After lunch, popped over to the SHroom to do work. Classifieds is BACK! IN BLACK! Errr... well it is looking spiffier than ever, haha, but you guys won't see that until school starts. You can now upload your own pictures :D. And unfortunately enough, the random picture I chose to test it with was of a rabbit humping a chicken. You really don't want to know. *IMMEDIATE DELETE* I'm also porting over a new code system, woohoo! Phil popped up too to print out some stuff and do other stuff. I also grabbed my transcript to apply for a $100 scholarship for being in a fashion show and doing some other Relay For Life. Hahaha, yes, I shall be a model along with Darren and Wendy, and possibly some of the people who my mom randomly enticed when they were over. Woot.<br /><br />I just finished watching Pitch Black, a movie suggested by some counselor at boy scout camp. It's based off Isaac Asimov's Nightfall, but really isn't anything like it. She kinda is a big Vin Diesel fan *blink blink*, considering she suggested A Man Apart, Pitch Black, The Pacifier, and The Chronicles of Riddick. Derr.. she totally described it wrong, and instead described the book as the movie. Bad counselor.<br /><br />On Tuesday, after sitting through another exciting session of gov (no sarcasm indeed), I downloaded more crap until 3:30, then I popped over to Darren's house for my uh.. very first guitar lesson! Wooohooo! I are teh utter noob. I uh.. did a scale and some chords. Yay. Darren played along with Love Me Do, or at least tried. I like the teacher, she is pretty nice and good I think. Well I really don't know what I am talking about. It's okay though, everyone starts out that way, hahaha. And uh.. I have no idea how my parents lost a guitar in my own house. I think I can borrow my cousin's then and replace the strings. And then randomly, I got asked to stay for dinner, and so I ended up hanging out at Darren's house until 11 or so. Woohoo! I uhh practiced a bit more in that time and also stole some C++ books. Darren suggests the USACO, and I think I will do it. Yay. Programming is teh fun. I seem to have about 3 possibly software / tech jobs lined up for me next summer O_o. I'm wanted, haha.<br /><br />EDIT: Hey, I found the start of my other entry. I can't believe I never had Semisonic - Closing Time. I always assumed it was by Green Day, and that I downloaded it somewhere.

I don't think my highway driving was up to par today, but it sufficed.

That also meant that you can see 7+ shows going on at the same time, which was really cool. It ended too soon though, mostly because my dad and I were wandering about confused previously. After it ended, I could see why Ninad described it as a popular spot - hordes of people were jammed leaving the hill. Oh, and also the cops came and busted a couple of people illegally launching their own fireworks up in the hill, hahaha. Afterwards, my dad and I wandered around for a bit looking for a good spot. We found a REALLY NICE unobstructed view at the end of a court. So maybe I can take people up there next year to see the super nice view and 7+ shows at the same time?

Thank you soooo much everyone! Kathleen for the cake and dessert, a lot of you guys apparently for the Gamecube, Vicky for the dessert, Wendy for the pie, Matt for the books (especially the North Beach Diet, LOL), David for another book, Darren for a gift certificate, and Christine for the IOU, haha. I'm still really really impressed that you guys gave me a Gamecube... are you trying to make my productivity go down to 0 again? :P Hahaha just kidding, thank you very, very much.<br /><br />We played some SSBM in the beginning, then Bridge and Napoleon and Mahjong. Anderthan, Bryant, Ninad, and I tried to start some water rugby, but not enough people wanted to play, so we swam around, then we tried to throw Henry in the pool, but that failed. And HAH Anderthan, you AREN'T 150 lbs. Went back to more games, Mario Tennis, and cards, etc... Haha, I saw that Scott and Allison were playing CS a lot of the time, and now Allison is addicted, hahaha. Around 5, Wendy and Allison left for dance, and we played a bit more until we went off to the Elephant Bar, where DARREN showed up, and I also got a cool dessert from Vicky and Kathleen.<br /><br />After that, we went off to Homestead Lanes to play pool, cards, and go bowl. HAHA we are SO BAD at bowling, oh man... Bryant was a monster the first game, then he sucked the second. I ended up with 92 and probably would have broken 100 on the second, but we were kicked off. Uhh.. and uhh nice soda mixture we got, haha. Oh mannn I feel so bad because we didn't go back earlier, otherwise Tiffany and Elaine would have come. Instead, they said screw it at 10:00. But apparently Susan stopped by and we weren't here, but I got her to come anyways afterwards. Kathleen got dropped off at home, and Robbie popped up around 10:10 or so. We watched Memento then and Team America. Memento... makes my head hurts.. but less than it does right now. Team America was hella funny. AMERICA, FUCK YEA! Hahhahahaha. Anyways, we played Smash and Tennis and other crap until 3, then we attempted to sleep, but instead ended up playing Contact for 2 hours until 5. There was also a separate room that I had no idea what they were doing... buttsex? I dunno. LOL. Well, we eventually all went to sleep.<br /><br />Someone left a pair of glasses at my house.. who does it belong to?<br /><br />Next day, woke up, played more games with the people, ate breakfast, and then about 11:20 or so, everyone left, as we had a concert to attend. Ugh.. cell phone was out of batteries and mom was at Safeway, so I was rushing all around, and also had to steal my dad's cell. Which I promptly then left in my car as soon as we left the school. The concert started out with some so so bands, so we decided to go instead play frisbee, then walk off to Subway to eat lunch. We came back, checked out Tragedy Andy and 5606, who were pretty good. Unfortunately, a mosh pit / fight started, and dust was everywhere, so I kinda left to watch at a distance, then grabbed a free cd, then left again. Wendy and David showed up with a huge picnic, and that was pretty cool.<br /><br />Bowling for Soup was pretty good. Very fun and exciting, and good music too. Oh, beer drinking while playing, and calling the audience really hot very frequently. Hahahaha. Mmm... we hung out after their bit.. played Frisbee, ate shaved ice (thanks Kat!), etc.. Then Crossfade came on, and I didn't really like them, so we wandered off to go throw stuff around and lay down. Then Kat and Darren and Vicky disappeared, so Jeff and I went to go look for them. Vicky, Henry, Jason, Kat, and Darren decided to go off and eat dinner, then go home, because they were partial on Better than Ezra. BUT YOU GUYS TOTALLY MISSED OUT. Crossfade finished off with Cold, which was pretty good, then it took a while for Better Than Ezra to get started. After 2 or so songs, Better Than Ezra did was to tell us all to jump the barrier and get up RIGHT next to the stage. Woot! Next, while playing, they started throwing guitar picks out to everyone. I think someone stuck their bra onto stage, and BTE made a big deal out of it (in a good meaning though), and tied it up for public display, hahaha. After a while, they got a guy to come up on stage and play the cowbell while doing totally random things while running around stage. Hahhaha... so very amusing. Good songs, right next to stage, complete amusement, free picks.. yea.. you guys missed out. I didn't get any picks though, so poo.. but Ninad, Jin, Jeff, and plenty of other Saratoga people did. We stole a bunch of signs from the event; I ripped one straight off, breaking the zip ties, woot. We stopped by Donut Wheel afterwards, then dropped me at the school, where I conveniently found my cell phone in my car.. oops. Ninad and Jin stopped by my house to pick up a Xbox and Ninad's sleeping bag. Oh.. and Darren and I were supposed to go to a dinner party, supposedly very important, but we kinda.. skipped that because of the lack of rides.

Did even more work on saratogahigh.org. Earning my $500, mmhmm.<br /><br />Later on, I dropped by Tiffany's house to drop off Relay money, then Henry's house to see the recently returned Enrique. We played WWE wrestling, woot! It was so frigging stupid. Then he randomly enticed me to go watch Batman Begins. OMG so good :). Vicky said she would ask her mom to see if there were openings for me at her mom's company. Hmmmm seems interesting. I'll be trying to learn C++ at summer camp, hah.<br /><br />So anyways, I'll be gone for a week in an internetless and musicless middle of nowhere place to go screw around. Hello rifle shooting XD! See you guys.. in a week?<br /><br />Oh yes, and um.. I'll be having a birthday party on July 2, from 1 PM - 11 PM most probably. If you know me come. If want to give me a gift, make food, I need the fat ;).<br /><br />Sigh.. missing BBQ, Tiffany's birthday party, Relay party. Zzzz.. oh well.

Hooray!<br /><br />Haha one poker game I played all 4 remaining people tied with a straight to the Jack, because that was the draw. It was so WTF? Played some bridge with Wendy, Ninad, and Anderthan. Ugh, I got laughed off the Advanced Room. Well actually, I get repeatedly laughed off the Advanced Lounge :(. It's okay, we dominated Wendy and Ninad anyways :P.<br /><br />So anyways, I stopped by the LAN yesterday at Bryant's house to play uh Yahoo Games. Came home and played more stuff until 3:30 AM, which set me up for being extremely stoned today. In the morning I had a doctors appointment - a physical. Those things are so silly, haha. Drove to Home Depot, came back, and promptly fell asleep.<br /><br />Mmm I love accelerating like a crazy madman. It's a healthy release, I think, to look at the person next to you and say OWNED. Hahahaha.<br /><br />I worked on my Eagle Project for a bit. The planters are BUILT! They only need to be stained now, and *foof* done! Ryan stopped by and helped out, then he enticed me to go SCUBA DIVING with Mr. Kucer. Well actually, today was the introduction, but we did get to dive in the school pool. Cool people there: Ryan, Amanda, Dora, Lisa Chu, Fred.. uh Mr. Kucer. Heh. I didn't think I would be back in that room so soon. Also, some people made really really large butterflies - I was quite impressed.<br /><br />I worked on saratogahigh.org a bit more... I'm going to MAKE myself worth the $500. And next year, we will work out another contract. Maybe I can get paid more?<br /><br />Ah, and on Thursday Richard helped out to make the planter. I went to Barnes and Noble after that to get the Lang readings - Sophie's World and The Elements of Style. I didn't want to spend money to get some other cool books, so I either noted them down on my hand for mad piracy later - The Girl with the Pearl Earring, The Dogs of Babel, The Merchant of Venice, or read them in store - Eats, Shoots, and Leaves, or just didn't buy them - The Idiot's Guide to Learning Latin. Haha. The order of languages I would like to learn if I was really bored would be - Latin, Taiwanese, and Cantonese. I'll start off with Latin. Heh. Unfortunately, I was unable to find the Dogs of Babel online. Poop.<br /><br />Later on that day, I went running with Wendy, and she also gave me her pictures for me to scan in. We ran to Jin's house, then Kathleen's house. Kathleen decided to randomly join us, so we went running off to Jin's house because Kathleen had never been there before. Yes, in retrospect, that was a problem, because we were led off in a wild goose chase off somewhere in Campbell, but found his house anyways. Ping Pong! Yes! Haha. Anyways, dear father Jin drove the pooped out Wendy and Kathleen back to Kathleen's house, then Wendy to my house. We love dear father Jin :). Wendy and I ran.. approximately 4.5 miles that day? Yawn.. that was easy; we should go running again sometime! :) I should also get a YMCA membership so I can work out with Jin, haha.<br /><br />High quality photo scanning is hard work! I didn't know that higher resolutions produced more artifacts... zz that would have saved me a lot of trouble! Seriously.. then photoshopping the artifacts out. At least they are done... I scanned in my prom picture too, so maybe I can finally make extra wallet copies now?<br /><br />Hahaha, David has some pretty strangely named songs. Like Fall Out Boy - Our Lawyers Made Us Change The Title Of This Song So We Wouldn't Be Sued, or Anberlin - Dance, Dance Christa Paffgen. And this song too, but that was from my sister. Oh yes... I ditched her graduation because I'm an awesome brother. Err I had work to do, sorry. :(<br /><br />Wow, a lot of people I know get to laugh at their freshmen siblings next year. No, actually it's going to be really weird. Hm. Also, I'll have to drive my sister to school everyday, which is good because it means I can drive everyday next year. The bad part is that she is already good at making her Redwood carpool late EVERY SINGLE DAY, and they leave at 7:50. I'm either screwed, or I'll have to ditch my sister everyday until she learns not to be late. Ugh.<br /><br />I need to pack for Chawanakee tomorrow... seriously. Yawn. And what's with the random stack of college mail? It also seems I'm tutoring my neighbor at Bio over the summer? Hmm. So anyways, I'll be gone for a week, so see you all later! Wow..

Woke up and had to carry ALL that junk to school. Ick. At least I got to drive. In APUS we got to throw our tests at people who never used an oops test or did a retake. 4th period, as said below, I found out that Bio was full. Grrr.. I'm merging that entry into this.<br /><br />Quote self:<br />Hey, hey, why is Bio full? Not cool. Not cool at all. Open access should go die.<br /><br />I guess I'll have to go bug the heck out of Augenstein.

Help is appreciated!<br /><br />Anyways.... well, our calculus project succeeded in exploding everyone in the room's brains. If you want to take a gander and explode your brain also, you can go <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surreal_number">here</a>. Very interesting. Well, after school, uhh.. William, Matthew, and I went to Sacred Heart for Spanish community service. And obviously, William and Matthew were magically transported there *cough* over 20 minutes of highway and such *cough* while I obviously drove alone *cough*. I seem to have a bad cough, I might need a glass of water. ;). Those homeless people are silly. They have better junk food than my house does. Sigh.<br /><br />We found Ravi there, so that William and Matthew were not *magically transporting* again, and instead were brought home by Ravi's mom. I don't even know why I followed her on the highway. I could have gotten back fine, but she took weird turns and ended up farther than where we wanted to be, and then got stuck in traffic. I refused to use the carpool lane and was then subsequently stuck, and extremely late for the Shrek 2 in Spanish. OMG that movie is hilarious, haha. Especially in Spanish. Spanish makes ANY movie funny, even more so with Disney. Afterwards, I went off to Wendy's house to go bake for Senior Slave Day and check out her costumes. I baked: apple crunch, and triple chocolate brownies. She did the double chocolate chip cookies. I chose out the fertility goddess costume ;). Oh man my mom was terribly mad at me for uhh.. not appearing at home until 11:00. Oops.<br /><br />Actually, here are the recipes for the triple chocolate brownies and apple crisp. Mmmm. So I *can* bake pastries okay, haha.<br /><br />Apple Crunch (I took this out of the 50's cookbook Grenier gave me)<br /><br />3 pounds cooking apples (McIntosh are fine)<br />1 cup flour<br />1/2 cup sugar<br />1/2 cup (1 stick butter)<br />Nutmeg<br />Cinnamon<br /><br />Peel, core, and slice apples and place in a buttered baking dish. Mix flour and sugar well. Mix them to a paste with the butter. Spread over the top of the appels. Sprinkle with nutmeg and cinnamon. Bake in 375 degree oven 35 minutes. Serve with whipped cream if desired.<br /><br />Triple Chocolate Brownies (Previously known as Goop, now known as extremely good)<br /><br />Brownies:<br />1/3 cup butter<br />3 squares unsweetened chocolate<br />2/3 cup flour<br />1/2 teaspoon baking powder<br />1/4 teaspoon salt<br />2 eggs<br />3/4 cup sugar<br />1 teaspoon vanilla<br />1 cup white chocolate chips<br /><br />Icing:<br />4 oz. milk chocolate<br />3 tablespoons butter<br /><br />Directions:<br /><br />Brownies:<br />Melt butter and chocolate together. Set aside to cool.<br /><br />In a small bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt.<br /><br />In a large bowl beat eggs. Blend in sugar. Add chocolate mixture and vanilla. Stir in flour mixture, and white chocolate chips.<br /><br />Pour into a greased 8 inch square pan. Bake at 325 degrees F. for 18 to 20 minutes. Cool.<br /><br />Icing:<br />Melt milk chocolate and butter together.<br /><br />Spread over the cooled cake. Cool and cut into squares. Store in refrigerator.<br /><br />I burned a Britney + other songs mix to blast with a boombox, but unfortunately, I was unable to find a boombox that worked and that I had enough batteries for. Darn. So I basically made Wendy twirl around a bit, carry some of my stuff, and buy me Quiznos. Mmm Steakhouse Beef Dip :). I didn't really care that you didn't really do anything super embarrassing. Baked goods is good enough, haha. Oh man some of the other slaves, I feel so very sorry for them. Went home.. and wow it was so very hot. Ohman.<br /><br />Thursday, well, was a normal day. In APUS, I called in my neighbor, and Arvind called in another WWII veteran, to talk about their experiences in WWII. It was really awesome and informative. We did tape it too. Maybe if we transfer it to VHS or DVD form, we can make Anzalone's class watch too, bwahaha. I saw this in the Tech Room:<br /><br />Apparently I've been prebanned from the sofa. Ohwell, I deserve it. So the story is.. freshman year? the Tech room had a sofa. It was nice. So anyways, over Winter Break, I left a Thermos full of beef stew on the sofa. When we came back, the sofa was covered in mold and we had to throw it out. So to Ms. Grenier and her crew and family, I am Beef Stew Michael Wu (it rhymes!), besides being a TA. Heh. I'm so very good. I went home, and did some Spanish filming. Look, it's me in uhh Don Quixote armor!

Pounce pounce pounce. I ditched Stats for Torrens then ditched Torrens for Physics. Hehhe. Afterwards, I dropped off receipts at Argonaut, then I went to get plants for my Eagle Project, and then came back home to study for SATs and do Kat's yearbook. I dropped off Knoppix at Ninad's house, came back, finished Kat's yearbook, then seeing as she was asleep, drove by at 10:30 and stuck it on your doormat. I assume you got it okay. Heh. Enjoy! Came home, failed more practice tests, then tried to sleep at 12:00. But noooo the gods of sleep say, 'Go to sleep at 2:00.' And so I couldn't sleep. Ughhhh.<br /><br />Haha, Andrew P.

At least I finished.<br /><br />Power went out today, as many of you witnessed. Too bad it did not go out for longer, but Saratoga High doesn't let you leave when power goes out. Darn. Speaking of sickness, the school was plagued by email viruses today, and I was called out of 3rd period by Grenier to go virus scan computers for 2 periods. The network was also down because of the power outage, and that was quite fun too.<br /><br />I bought 1gb of Corsair XMS memory for $169 at Fry's, but when I got back, there was 2x512mb Kingston for $59 after rebate. I don't think Corsair is worth $110 more, sheesh, so my dad is returning it today to get the other one.<br /><br />Looks like it is possible to make a profit on Ebay by buying cheap Fry's stuff and selling it off, but AFTER rebate. The tricky part is the reliability of the rebate part, and most probably explaining why the UPC code is missing. For example, a Western Digital SATA 160gb drive is on Ebay for $85 average, and the price at Fry's is $109 which goes to $49 after rebate. So I dunno. I'll do a bit more searching and see if I can set something up.<br /><br />Job search is actively going on now. I am emailing my resume to a bunch of local high schools, and having my parents pass it around also. Good thing I have a lot of experience with computer repair and etc.<br /><br />Should I program Speed Scrabble in Java or Python? The question about Python is it's ability to make applications. Java is kinda icky with it's virtual machining and stuff. I need to make some kind of dictionary search algorithm, UI, nodal word finder, networking, etc...<br /><br />VGcats isn't funny anymore, booooo.<br /><br />Need to obtain a can of Sprite somehow soon.

now/someone who actually plays guitar, but think are cool anyway), and adam's so good with the crowd, and my throat hurts from screaming but my voice is still intact, and i'd be a little more concerned about permanent hearing loss that i've sustained if i didn't like maroon 5 so damn much.<br /><br />did i mention we saw yumi + stacey yuen on the way out? saratoga presence, mm. ohh. and i

got to prepare the cells for RTPCR. today we loaded and ran the DNA on the agarose gel through gel electrophoresis (ahh..those good ol AP bio days.) but nothing showed up o_O so we i redid the three

drive back 50 miles to pick us up. fun. got to my aunt's house at 2 AM.<br /><br />anyway, working at the VA in SF is alright. the first few days were pretty boring cuz i had to read stuff. on tuesday i got to split/culture some cancer cells under the supervision of my instructor. on wednesday i watched her isolate the RNA from the cancer cells and then on thursday i got to prepare the cells for RTPCR. today we loaded and ran the DNA on the agarose gel through gel electrophoresis (ahh..those good ol AP bio days.) but nothing showed up o_O so we i redid the three samples we made yesterday and she made 3 more samples to test whether the primers were screwed up or whether i screwed up when we preped for PCR (i probably did.) <br /><br />working in a lab is pretty fun but also really different from lab stuff we do at school. the equipment is larger and for cell splitting, we work with large glass pipettes that we throw away after one use. we use micropipetters for the PCR and isolation stuff so it was usual..expect they had P1000's too.<br /><br />next week i get to split, isolate RNA and do RTPCR and gel electrophoresis by myself with my instructor's supervision as well as learn how to do real-time pcr by watching another of the PhD's working at the lab. fun stuff.<br /><br />anyway it's good to be home, even for only the weekend

Evan regarding our first shoot tomorrow morning (augh, have to be on location at 8am) and the subject came to how much control the director should have on set. The way things works is we rotate within the group between 4 roles: director, camera operator, assistant, and editor (the editor is not on set but rather editing the footage for which she was director). Some people get all fussy and insist the group do it 'as if it were a pro shoot,' but I mean come on... this is our first attempt... like it or not, we're amateurs. And really, a crew of four people? Please. I don't get why so many people here pretend to be such hot shit cause even though we're in our second year we're still nothing. I said yeah, since there's only four of us there will probably be a lot of role-overlap so we shouldn't get too attached to roles. Jess said, "Good, so you don't have an ego." I joke, "Even if it IS my turn to direct, I don't really feel like it."<br /><br />Evan says, "Then why the hell are you here?"<a name="cutid1"></a> Ouch.<br />Thankfully, Jess is there to back me up while I mull it over. "Not everyone has to be a director."<br /><br />In all fairness, no one is really ready to direct as a sophomore. What could possibly have prepared us? Photography? Sound Editing? Writing classes? Don't think so. I mean yeah, I guess it's still a possibility. I'm really not into camera operator right now but who knows, maybe I will be later. I wasn't really into sound editing last year and later on that's what I had the most fun doing.

The way things works is we rotate within the group between 4 roles: director, camera operator, assistant, and editor (the editor is not on set but rather editing the footage for which she was director). Some people get all fussy and insist the group do it 'as if it were a pro shoot,' but I mean come on... this is our first attempt... like it or not, we're amateurs. And really, a crew of four people? Please. I don't get why so many people here pretend to be such hot shit cause even though we're in our second year we're still nothing. I said yeah, since there's only four of us there will probably be a lot of role-overlap so we shouldn't get too attached to roles. Jess said, "Good, so you don't have an ego." I joke, "Even if it IS my turn to direct, I don't really feel like it."<br /><br />Evan says, "Then why the hell are you here?"<a name="cutid1"></a> Ouch.<br />Thankfully, Jess is there to back me up while I mull it over. "Not everyone has to be a director."<br /><br />In all fairness, no one is really ready to direct as a sophomore. What could possibly have prepared us? Photography? Sound Editing? Writing classes? Don't think so. I mean yeah, I guess it's still a possibility. I'm really not into camera operator right now but who knows, maybe I will be later.

However, that's to be expected whenever imposing an 'exact' (mathematical) tool onto a 'slippery' (emotional) subject.<br /><br /><br />...<br /><br />that's the end of what i wrote. i suppose the only thing i can advocate is to carefully pick out what your positive and negative tests are and really take a long hard look at what you think about yourself in relation to those standards.<br /><br />my dilemma is... can you be infatuated and truly in love at the same time? can you 'fall in love' for the wrong reasons but end up really there? i'm ambivalent.<br /><br />personally, i am a true believer (to continue the infinite series analogy) of partial sums. maybe those fractions will never add up to x or y or z, but each time i go see a movie or have lunch or shop for shoes or whatever with someone i care about... that's real value. i value that. and though it may never end up where i want, i don't care, because the partial sum is a positive value. it might include a lot of zeroes, but i think the thing about love that people are missing is hidden in the partial sums.<br /><br />'Though I may never truly love, yet shall I love truly.'<br />-vdv";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1093427482;}i:17;a:7:{s:4:"guid";s:57:"http://www.livejournal.com/users/allfornaught/125974.html";s:7:"pubdate";s:29:"Mon, 23 Aug 2004 04:39:21 GMT";s:4:"link";s:57:"http://www.livejournal.com/users/allfornaught/125974.html";s:11:"description";s:1209:"<i>And I'll pretend I don't see you<br />pretending not to see me<br />And I'll pretend I'm someone else<br />since no one wants to be me</i><br /><br />so even though my birthday was july 22nd, my mom decides to throw a party on august 22nd... whatever. my aunt was craving pearl milk tea so i brought her and my sister and my cousin irene to tapx... saw mike chen there and kept mentioning cal (but he goes to northwestern! doh!) and also karen's sister working there and i said to say hi for me (but she was like 'didn't you guys just hang out like a day or two ago?' ...

NO MORE MISTER NICE GUY. you know why? cause that's not me.<br /><br />i'm shy, yeah. and i have social anxiety disorder. but yknow what? i can still get up on stage and act or sing or play the guitar; i can still tell stories for hours and have everyone right there with me.<br /><br />i wish there were an easier way to be the me that i am around my friends all the time.<br /><a name="cutid1"></a><br />To paraphrase tonight's reading: The problem with nice guys is that they are 'nice guys' and not 'guys who happen to be nice.' They think that by pleasing others they are automatically entitled to reciprocation. They feel the need to find someone else to complete their lives instead of completing themselves and then seeking a partner. The problem is not they are 'nice.'

I know that there are girls out there (and it seems like most of them) who only go for the wild and crazy guys, but I happen to like guys who can chill and have fun without any pressure. Nice guys. My roommate is dating one of the wild guys, and I'm dating *his* roommate, who is one of the sweetest, most low-key, nicest guys you'll ever meet. That's what drew me to him first ? he was cool, he knew how to have fun, but I could tell that there just wasn't a bone in his body that could intentionally hurt anyone unless they really hurt him first. I was really lucky that he fell in love with me, too; so I'm telling all of you nice guys to never, ever give up. There are girls out there that just need to come around and realize that nice guys are the kind of person that they need to be with. I don't even know if I completely deserve the love that I receive from my nice guy, but I'm really glad I have it!<br />.Nice Guy Fanatic </i><br /><br /><br />and another:<br /><br /><br /><i>.All too often, guys think that being "nice" implies giving the girl everything she wants, and no more. So these guys don't seem to have their own passions, their own excitement for life; they never show the girl anything new because they figure they are supposed to be passive. Sadly enough this is not the case! "Nice" guys, you can get all the girls you want: keep on caring and wanting to please (that's wonderful!), it just takes a little perspective on what women want. Women don't want a man who will blandly agree with them on everything; they want someone who will talk with them, listen well, and yet challenge their views. You should have your own opinions and your own exciting life, even as you care deeply for theirs. That way, you can both introduce each other to new things, and it's called "romance," not friendship. You can take a playful attitude towards romance, and try different things sometimes to play with emotions and see what happens. Things like jealousy and nervousness can go too far; but if taken with a playful attitude, they create drama. Don't avoid these things completely. Again, it is drama that makes the difference between friendship and romance. Being "nice" doesn't mean you always sit back and wait for her to do things; try something new, take initiative. If you really care about her, you will know that she will really enjoy it. She will start to take initiative on things as well. You will have a huge advantage over the mean guys! But either way, "nice" guys, keep it up. I think you are wonderful.</i><br /><br /><br />and another!<br /><br /><br /><i>.One of my nice guy friends asked me why women don't see him. I replied, "The jerks have no problems speaking up and sometimes it's hard to hear your soft genuine admiration over their loud shallow compliments". And please don't hold it against us if we don't realize right away that you're the [right] guy for us. It may take us a little longer to fall for you, but it'll last twice as long.</i><br /><br /><br />and (another) bitter guy =P<br /><br /><br /><i>.I want to put this out as a warning to the younger girls out there. Nice guys are boring. Of course, when you start dating in high school and in college, you want fun and excitement, and while most nice guys can do that, we certainly aren't as fun as bad boys. But eventually you learn that bad boys are just that, and then you can have a much more stable and meaningful relationship with a nice guy who respects you.<br />.Here is the warning: while you are learning, so are we. And we are learning from you that being nice will get us nowhere and only guys who are stereotypically "bad" will get the girl. I've seen nice guys fed up with this scenario only to start treating women badly because they feel it's what you want. I've even, myself, felt like being nice and caring is a waste of time, since all it brings is solitude. Fortunately, that is not all it brings; it also makes you feel good, and even un-returned kindness is generally a good feeling.<br />.Of course, I am not suggesting it's a girl's fault that her boyfriend is a jerk, but by staying with him, you are sending a message to all the other guys that he is the ideal. </i><br /><br /><br />some comforting words:<br /><br /><br /><i>.Nice guys are almost always the ones who have a lasting marriage. My Father is one of those "nice guys"; he still brings my Mother flowers for no reason and they've been married for 32 years! And, I've found one of those "rare" nice guys in my present boyfriend. We've been dating, long-distance, for 3-1/2 years. He will drive 2 hours to see me, stay for only 5 - 6 hours, then he would drive home ? having to work at 8 AM the next day! He is very dedicated to me! I haven't had to pay for a thing since we started dating! He is sensitive, sincere, extremely handsome, respectful, etc...<br />.So, I'd like to say to that guy who was wondering why "nice guys finish last"...<br />.Don't give up!<br />.[We] women only fall for the bad guys for a short time until we discover who they "really" are; it never lasts. It usually ends up being just a physical thing. A relationship requires much more to last!<br />.Believe me! </i><br /><br /><br />I'm glad for this couple... I guess:<br /><br /><br /><i>.I have to admit that I always seem to fall for the charming player guys who turn out to be complete assholes. They always seem to be the exciting ones who make me feel special in the beginning. Because they have so much experience with women, they know exactly what to say even though they don't mean it. The nice guys always seemed to be more respectful by watching what they say and giving me more space, so I took it as they weren't interested in me, while the charming players told me all these other flattering things.<br />.But all these guys I became interested in were all wrong for me even though I thought they were so great in the beginning. I knew I wanted a nice guy, but was such a bad judge of character. Finally, I became interested in one of my guy friends who is definitely one of the nicest guys I have ever met. He's respectful and considerate, but still keeps me laughing all the time. </i><br /><br /><br />this almost sounds like something i'd write in the future:<br /><br /><br /><i>.I am thirtysomething, professional, reasonably physically appealing, and a well-rounded person. I am also a "nice guy" who has suffered the slings and arrows of unrequited love. I find merit in all of the responses. But I will try to add more to the discussion.<br />.I used to be a very passive "nice guy." But then as I began to grow and mature, I developed confidence and strength to complement the better angels of my nature. In my late 20s, I had a string of bad encounters with women I fell in love with. These women had one thing in common: they would work their way back into my trust when I would accept their desire to remain "friends" and walk away. But at the moment I had completely committed myself, they would abruptly pull away. Eventually, I indulged my dark side, sent my conscience on vacation, and manipulated and mistreated a string of women in a form of misdirected revenge against those who had hurt me. As I separated myself from those situations, I found that the women who had hurt me came back into my life, not to reconcile, but to ask for my friendship in ways I could not accept (seeing that they had since married). Today, I date occasionally, and even though I have grown in ways that I couldn't have imagined years ago, I still find myself in situations where the women in whom I am most interested have some obstruction to getting close to me.<br />.I say all this to say that it is difficult for emotionally honest, earnest men to find the women they really want. That's the politics, baby, and they're difficult to comprehend sometimes. But I have discovered some key coping skills that help me through these dilemmas: 1. Foster your interests and talents. Too many times, nice guys define themselves by what the woman of the moment thinks of them, instead of constantly redefining themselves. 2. Ask yourself the hard questions about your expectations, and whether you are really seeking the right things in a mate or a dating relationship. 3. Don't feel bad about dating around. Too many times, nice guys focus on one person. 4. Remember your past hurts, but only for the purpose of not repeating the same mistakes or falling into a similar pattern. 5. Sometimes things are going to be messed up. Sometimes you don't get what you want. That's a hard fact, but it must be accepted. 6. Develop a healthy cynicism about the opposite sex. Women are all too human. That cynicism will help you in avoiding a situation which will hurt you, but will also free you from idealizing a woman at first sight, and will give you greater confidence and freedom to be candid. 7. There's no shame in being a romantic or doing nice things for a woman, but don't expect a return. Send flowers, open doors, give compliments, write letters or poetry because it's on your heart, but earnest gestures are not always requited. In the right situation, they will be. 8. Be patient. 9. Be strong. 10. Trust in God's will. It ain't always pleasant, but it manifests itself for a reason. </i><br /><br /><br />this makes me want to throw up... or kick someone's ass...<br /><br /><br /><i>"I don't like a guy unless he's a jerk," Karen* said to me the other day.

The nice guys always seemed to be more respectful by watching what they say and giving me more space, so I took it as they weren't interested in me, while the charming players told me all these other flattering things.<br />.But all these guys I became interested in were all wrong for me even though I thought they were so great in the beginning. I knew I wanted a nice guy, but was such a bad judge of character. Finally, I became interested in one of my guy friends who is definitely one of the nicest guys I have ever met. He's respectful and considerate, but still keeps me laughing all the time. </i><br /><br /><br />this almost sounds like something i'd write in the future:<br /><br /><br /><i>.I am thirtysomething, professional, reasonably physically appealing, and a well-rounded person. I am also a "nice guy" who has suffered the slings and arrows of unrequited love. I find merit in all of the responses. But I will try to add more to the discussion.<br />.I used to be a very passive "nice guy." But then as I began to grow and mature, I developed confidence and strength to complement the better angels of my nature. In my late 20s, I had a string of bad encounters with women I fell in love with. These women had one thing in common: they would work their way back into my trust when I would accept their desire to remain "friends" and walk away. But at the moment I had completely committed myself, they would abruptly pull away. Eventually, I indulged my dark side, sent my conscience on vacation, and manipulated and mistreated a string of women in a form of misdirected revenge against those who had hurt me. As I separated myself from those situations, I found that the women who had hurt me came back into my life, not to reconcile, but to ask for my friendship in ways I could not accept (seeing that they had since married). Today, I date occasionally, and even though I have grown in ways that I couldn't have imagined years ago, I still find myself in situations where the women in whom I am most interested have some obstruction to getting close to me.<br />.I say all this to say that it is difficult for emotionally honest, earnest men to find the women they really want. That's the politics, baby, and they're difficult to comprehend sometimes. But I have discovered some key coping skills that help me through these dilemmas: 1. Foster your interests and talents. Too many times, nice guys define themselves by what the woman of the moment thinks of them, instead of constantly redefining themselves. 2. Ask yourself the hard questions about your expectations, and whether you are really seeking the right things in a mate or a dating relationship. 3. Don't feel bad about dating around. Too many times, nice guys focus on one person. 4. Remember your past hurts, but only for the purpose of not repeating the same mistakes or falling into a similar pattern. 5. Sometimes things are going to be messed up. Sometimes you don't get what you want. That's a hard fact, but it must be accepted. 6. Develop a healthy cynicism about the opposite sex. Women are all too human. That cynicism will help you in avoiding a situation which will hurt you, but will also free you from idealizing a woman at first sight, and will give you greater confidence and freedom to be candid. 7. There's no shame in being a romantic or doing nice things for a woman, but don't expect a return. Send flowers, open doors, give compliments, write letters or poetry because it's on your heart, but earnest gestures are not always requited. In the right situation, they will be. 8. Be patient. 9. Be strong. 10. Trust in God's will. It ain't always pleasant, but it manifests itself for a reason. </i><br /><br /><br />this makes me want to throw up... or kick someone's ass...<br /><br /><br /><i>"I don't like a guy unless he's a jerk," Karen* said to me the other day. Admittedly, Karen finds a man more interesting if he's not there for her. Despite offers from decent guys, she'd rather carry a torch for the man who requires more effort.<br /><br />I watch as the jerk du jour throws her a bone, only to disappear for a time. She holds onto those little moments until he graces her with his presence yet again.</i>";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1092898116;}i:22;a:7:{s:4:"guid";s:57:"http://www.livejournal.com/users/allfornaught/124854.html";s:7:"pubdate";s:29:"Wed, 18 Aug 2004 20:30:01 GMT";s:4:"link";s:57:"http://www.livejournal.com/users/allfornaught/124854.html";s:11:"description";s:268:"free food & a fashion show at the grand opening of a santana row shop tonight<br /><br />invited a few ppl to go but a lot can't make it...<br /><br />vdv: i'll toss an hors d'oeuvre on the ground for you<br />vdv: 'this one's for my homies that can't be here tonight'";s:8:"comments";s:57:"http://www.livejournal.com/users/allfornaught/124854.html";s:7:"summary";s:268:"free food & a fashion show at the grand opening of a santana row shop tonight<br /><br />invited a few ppl to go but a lot can't make it...<br /><br />vdv: i'll toss an hors d'oeuvre on the ground for you<br />vdv: 'this one's for my homies that can't be here tonight'";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1092861001;}i:23;a:8:{s:4:"guid";s:57:"http://www.livejournal.com/users/allfornaught/124472.html";s:7:"pubdate";s:29:"Mon, 16 Aug 2004 06:48:17 GMT";s:5:"title";s:10:"acceptance";s:4:"link";s:57:"http://www.livejournal.com/users/allfornaught/124472.html";s:11:"description";s:962:"i dreamt last night of winning an oscar<br /><br />well not really. i dreamt about making my acceptance speech.<br /><br />i think it went something like this.<br /><br />"It isn't until one stands right here that one fully understands what they mean when they say there just isn't enough time to thank everyone that by all rights should be thanked.

asked for<br />EP: plus the old system<br />EP: is not exactly fair<br />EP: i mean<br />EP: at first when u called logitech<br />EP: and u told me<br />EP: it was 75 more<br />EP: i thought logitech charged u 75 more<br />EP: for the newer system<br />EP: cuz it was the market price difference<br />EP: and i was like <br />EP: i guess fine<br />EP: i can pay for that<br />me: right<br />me: it's definitely one of those<br />me: i COULD have won the lottery<br />me: but i didn't<br />me: feelings<br />me: and to me, of course, since i'm biased, it feels like<br />me: i could have opened the box before you came and set them up like i had planned to<br />me: found it was broken, told you sorry, and warranteed it.<br />EP: i know<br />EP: thats why i thought<br />EP: technically when u warranty both systems are mine<br />EP: but at my house<br />EP: u said i could have new one<br />EP: and u could keep the old one<br />EP: minus one speaker<br />EP: and i was like ok sure<br />EP: cuz when u sell me a product<br />EP: the warranty is mine right...?<br />EP: even tho u did do the work<br />me: that's a good question actually... i don't know<br />EP: like this feels really stupid getting an arguement over<br />EP: but i know how u feel<br />EP: but u understand my side too right?<br />me: oh no i'm not annoyed or anything<br />me: hope you're not either<br />me: yeah<br />me: so<br />me: i think this was one of the best reasoned responses i got<br />me: x: i dont think that either of the arguments/ways to resolve the situation are the way to go<br />x: it seems to me that A wouldn't have known the speakers were broken unless B had purchased them and stuff<br />x: A could have sold them via ebay, and then dealt with an external unhappy 3rd party<br />x: so it seems B deserves some credit&nbsp; for finding the broken-ness<br />x: still, it seems to "cheat" A to say that B owns the speakers, the new ones, as without A, B probably wouldn't have been able to get a replacement<br />x: because of the receipts/orig. purchaser stuff<br />x: i would think that perhaps some monetary compromise is in order... if i were buying the speakers in question, i would find a $75 increase very hard to stomach<br /><br />EP: k<br />EP: well<br />EP: i told u that the old ones<br />EP: we missed a volume switch right?<br />EP: so everythings still perfect<br />me: yeah you did<br />EP: in terms of sound<br />EP: i nearly popped my eardrums finding out<br />me: ... it's just missing one of the front two speakers<br />me: haha<br />EP: but anyways<br />EP: u dont think its fair if i get new while u get old?<br />EP: i mean im still paying 150<br />EP: and ure getting the old set free<br />EP: i guess<br />EP: if 150 was equal to ur new set's cost<br />EP: erm old<br />EP: see how i saw the warranty situation is<br />EP: not something really to be gained from<br />EP: but since logitech sells u a product<br />EP: that doenst work<br />EP: its their responsibility<br />EP: to <br />EP: replace it<br />EP: with one that works right?<br />EP: but then<br />EP: it just happens<br />EP: that they dont have this model<br />EP: and like wise<br />EP: it seems like<br />EP: since u sold me something that doenst work<br />EP: its ur responsibility to do the same?<br />EP: if that makes sense<br />me: yeah<br />me: so i should replace it with what i promised<br />me: by your logic:p<br />EP: lol<br />me: haha well<br />EP: ok<br />EP: but honestly<br />EP: if u went out<br />EP: and bought a 680<br />EP: and gave it to me<br />EP: i think thats just ridiculous<br />EP: lol<br />EP: i mean<br />EP: its totally unecessary<br />EP: its a third speaker system<br />me: haha yeah<br />EP: and we end as a whole<br />EP: losing money<br />me: haha no<br />EP: in terms of shipping<br />EP: etc<br />me: actually, no<br />me: we'd both hurt ourselves, but we wouldn't lose money<br />EP: well<br />EP: we hurt ourselves by losing money?<br />EP: lol<br />me: ok this is a fun debate i will continue later<br />EP: no?<br />me: sorry gg<br />me: no<br />EP: ok<br />EP: holdup<br />EP: the 5500 speakers<br />EP: are 6 foot cables right?<br />EP: or are they longer<br />me: dunno<br />me: sorry<br />me: bye<br />EP: ok<br />me: oh<br />EP: i guess we can continue at a later date<br />me: they're not speaker cables though<br />EP: hey<br /><br />Auto response from me: bbl<br /><br />EP: i just thought of something<br />EP: u know whats the best idea<br />EP: lol<br />EP: write a copy of what happened<br />EP: show it to me<br />EP: if i think its fiar<br />EP: put it on ur lj<br />EP: and poll it<br />EP: leaving all sorts of combinations of results<br />EP: and we ONLY decide<br />EP: if any of the choices<br />EP: is over 75%<br />EP: but otherwsie serves as guideline<br />EP: at least 25 votes<br />EP: and u can track ips right<br />EP: so no same voting<br />EP: lol<br />EP: or u could have ppl just leave comments<br />EP: instead of poll<br />EP: cuz i only asked 2 ppl<br />EP: and i showed it to u<br />EP: otherwise<br />EP: 50/50 it in terms of monetary advantage<br />EP: price the old speakers at a cost<br />EP: see how much i should gain from this<br />EP: and how much u should<br />EP is away at 9:26:00. <br />EP returned at 12:13:42. <br />EP: so<br />EP: how long for the shipping<br />me: a couple weeks<br />EP: so<br />EP: how exactly<br />EP: are we going to reach our conclusion<br />EP: lol<br />me: it basically comes down to<br />me: i got lucky<br />me: how much luck should i share with you<br />me: where luck<br />me: is actually money<br />me::)<br />EP: lol<br />me: obviously if i'd gotten 680's as replacements<br />me: there'd be no issues:)<br />EP: u really see it that way huh<br />EP: lol<br />me: no? <br />EP: i already told u my view, no?<br />me: how do they contradict what i just said?<br />me: "if i'd gotten 680's"<br />me: "there'd be no issue"<br />EP: nono<br />me: isn't that true<br />EP: not that<br />EP: the top part<br />EP: before that<br />me: the top part is the logical conclusion to the bottom<br />me: so i got 5500's instead of 680's, which was lucky<br />EP: me: it basically comes down to<br />me: i got lucky<br />me: how much luck should i share with you<br />EP: thats the part<br />EP: that i said i didnt share the same view<br />me: how so<br />EP: let me ask you something<br />EP: lessay i buy a computer<br />EP: i sell it to a third party<br />EP: through ebay<br />EP: on the other side of the world<br />EP: dont u send the warranty?<br />EP: lool<br />EP: do you seriously keep the warranty<br />EP: or were u planning on telling me<br />EP: taht u didnt sell the warranty to me<br />EP: ok<br />EP: so lessay another scenario<br />EP: i buy it<br />EP: i never use it<br />EP: i never find out its broken<br />EP: its not your loss right?<br />EP: cuz our stuff is done<br />EP: u got 150 for ur system<br />EP: and i paid 150 for a systen<br />EP: that i dont use<br />EP: so what i dont understand<br />EP: is how you are lucky<br />EP: if you see what i mean<br />EP: i honestly think<br />EP: by all TECHNICALITIES<br />EP: even tho<br />EP: thats not the way we do things<br />EP: our stuff is done. and youre bascially warrantying it for me<br />EP: no?<br />me: mm, the last one-- an equally valid scenario: i test the speakers. i warranty the speakers. i sell you the newly fixed speakers. it didn't happen... but neither did your "keep it and not use it ever" scenario<br />EP: so i guess if i piad you for hte "time" and effort it took to warranty<br />me: yeah, i see<br />EP: yes but my scenario<br />EP: is just trying to show u<br />me: so i guess we have two options<br />EP: ok umm<br />EP: i lost connection<br />EP: for like 5 minutes<br />me: technicalities<br />EP: so this is the last thing i have on my screen<br />me: no i didn't say anything<br />EP: <br />EP: of transactions<br />EP: k<br />me: technicalities<br />me: or "feelings"<br />me: should we use the techical result then?<br />EP: huh?<br />EP: the techical result?<br />me: your argument<br />EP: yes what about it?<br />me: which is that technically, the warranty is yours, so you should get the replacement<br />EP: ok..?<br />me: so do you want to decide it by the warranty<br />me: or would that not be enough<br />EP: i dont understand<br />EP: what ure trying to get at<br />me: let's say the warranty isn't transferable <br />EP: ok<br />EP: lol<br />me: would you then conclude, oh, the warranty was yours, never mind?<br />EP: see<br />EP: ok<br />EP: how much is the set that i have worth?<br />EP: 100?<br />me: legally nontransferable<br />EP: is it about 100?<br />EP: put a tag on it<br />me: i would say so... it depends on the buyer, but 100 is reasonable<br />EP: ok<br />EP: so if we tag it at 100<br />EP: u giving me the new one<br />EP: i get +75 EV<br />me: <br />EP: u get old one<br />EP: youre getting +100 EV<br />me: <br />me:&nbsp; )<br />EP: so EVEN tho the warranty is "mine"<br />EP: ure getting 100, no?<br />EP: more than me<br />EP: lol<br />EP: well ok<br />EP: what i meant by technicalities<br />EP: was that<br />EP: in the court of law<br />EP: im PRETTY sure<br />EP: id get both?<br />EP: lol<br />me: ok<br />me: so if it turns out<br />me: that in a court of law<br />me: the warranty would not have been transferred<br />EP: thats why i say we dont do things that way<br />EP: ok<br />me: haha ok<br />EP: then i guess<br />EP: u hold the warranty<br />EP: i hold the product<br />EP: you lose a possible +100 EV<br />EP: i lose a possible +75 VE<br />EP: lol<br />EP: no?<br />EP: we hurt each other<br />me: nope, i'd still have the new set.<br />EP: lol<br />EP: you CANT warranty a set thats not yours<br />EP: ....<br />me: if the warranty were nontransferable and stayed with me<br />me: then yes<br />EP: ok is the warranty online<br />me: as long as i fulfill the obligations that logitech sets out&nbsp; <br />EP: i pretty damn sure<br />EP: that if ure no longeri n possession of the item<br />EP: u may not warranty it<br />me: hahaa<br />EP: otherwise u could lose the item and warranty it<br />EP: rofl<br />me: too bad neither of us are lawyers<br />EP: lol<br />EP: u really think u can warranty an item<br />EP: that u dont have possession of?<br />EP: but see<br />me: haha<br />EP: i dont understand WHY you want split<br />EP: the benefit<br />EP: in a way<br />EP: thats already<br />EP: benefiting you MORE than me<br />EP: especailyl when i honestly believe<br />EP: that TECHNICALLY<br />EP: you shouldnt be getting anything<br />EP: ok<br />EP: post on lj<br />EP: ur lj<br />EP: lol<br />me: alright let's trace it<br />EP: vote <br />me: haha nah<br />EP: i honestly cant see<br />EP: ppl agreeing with u<br />EP: even 1 or 2<br />EP: get 2 extreme ppl<br />EP: i showed u the ONLY 2 ppl i asked<br />me: so let's say, then<br />EP: now yes thats my wordo f honor<br />EP: i didnt selectively show<br />me: i believe you<br />me: i do<br />EP: so ok, in this whole scheme<br />EP: together<br />me: so let's say i can't warranty a product without it physically here<br />EP: we net 175 EV<br />EP: how muhc<br />EP: did u plan on giving me<br />EP: since thats about our conclusion<br />EP: assuming its yours to give of course<br />EP::P<br />me: well, actually<br />me: i hate to correct you on this <br />me: oh, i see<br />me: b/c the est. value of the 680's dropped<br />EP: yes<br />EP: i mean<br />EP: how much less than 75<br />EP: were u planning on giving me<br />EP: its not like youre getting shafted<br />EP: ure netting 100<br />EP: no?<br />me: hehe it depends on how far we go back<br />me: prior to buying the speakers, we were "even"<br />EP: yes<br />me: once you bought them, you were paying $150 for something you would have paid $200 for on the next cheapest outlet, ebay<br />EP: factor in the used + the fact that its costing u the same cuz ure sending shipping<br />EP: and if u want the cables<br />EP: i can give them back<br />me: ignore the cables for now<br />EP: ok<br />EP: but for a used system on ebay<br />me: hm... true<br />EP: its under 150<br />EP: and the 50 shipping<br />EP: is just being transferred<br />EP: as me paying the postage<br />EP: u dont really net anything more right?<br />EP: u have to pay 50 to ship<br />EP: and charge someone 50<br />me: yes, it would have benefited you and not benefited me&nbsp; <br />EP: why should i have to pay shipping if i drive and pickup the item anyways right?<br />EP: shipping cost is to a third party for a service<br />me: how would you have avoided the shipping cost?<br />EP: i cant<br />me: so $125 for $150 value<br />me: sorry<br />EP: i decide if an extra 50 is worth it<br />EP: or i switch models<br />me: $150 for $175<br />EP: how are yo ugetting 175<br />me: 125 + 50 shipping<br />EP: i showed u on ebay<br />EP: 150+50 <br />EP: is brand new right<br />EP: buyit now price from store<br />EP: or was it 140+50<br />me: yeah... there's some new ones going for 145+50<br />EP: yea<br />EP: i think the biggest thing right now for me<br />EP: is that by giving u the older system<br />EP: and keeping hte new one<br />EP: i already feel like im doing u a facor<br />EP: *favor<br />EP: lol<br />EP: so for me to add on<br />EP: really sounds not possible<br />EP: like both mathematically<br />EP: and technically in the court of law<br />EP: lol<br />EP: i dont see how youre unhappy with<br />EP: u know<br />EP: how u gave me this system<br />EP: ure getting every piece back<br />EP: all ure getting<br />EP: is a net of 150 dollars<br />EP: lol<br />EP: nothing is happeneing<br />EP: ure keeping the same system<br />EP: that u gave me<br />EP: even tho we know its broken<br />EP: so its value is down<br />EP: ure free rolling 150<br />EP: - whatever less its worth<br />EP: if i came to your house<br />EP: and i crushed your system<br />EP: in accident<br />EP: id pay u 150<br />EP: right?<br />EP: not 150+225<br />EP: lol<br />EP: theres no jackpot to be hit<br />EP: lol<br />EP: when u warranty something<br />EP: ure not SUPPOSED to gain<br />EP: ure supposed to come back to neutral EV<br />me: except i just did<br />me: i think the biggest thing right now for me, is that by selling you the new one, i'm already doing you a favor, by saving you $50 and the risk of buying off ebay, or $75 buying offazon; and if i had remembered to check if the speakers were working, this wouldn't even matter; and this is still, i think, about whether i should share my luck, since the warranty is nontransferable apparently <br />me: also, i'm still not annoyed, if i sound like i.<br />me: if i'd bought a lottery ticket that you caused me to buy&nbsp; all your hypothetical scenarios would still be in effect-- if it wasn't for you i wouldn't have won<br />me: and yet i would be the one who got it, and despite it being rather lucky, i wouldn't be obligated to split it 100/75 with you<br />EP: correct<br />EP: except u sold the lottery ticket<br />EP: and then u found out u could cash it in<br />EP: for a bonus aamount<br />me: <br />EP: but the product isnt yours<br />EP: lol<br />EP: can u warranty a lost product?<br />me: that's true<br />me: so i ripped up my ticket<br />me: and you magically put it back together for me<br />me: hahahaha<br />EP: i guess u can say<br />EP: u ripped up ur ticket into a million pieces<br />EP: i found it on the ground and put it back together<br />EP: lol<br />EP: but <br />EP: thats such a bad analogy<br />EP: i dont even want to use it<br />me: true<br />me: this is why<br />me: it's bad to win the lotto<br />me: everyone you know<br />me: well, i shouldn't finish this analogy either:)<br />EP: lol<br />EP: under the limited warranty<br />EP: it says<br />EP: remedies<br />EP: logitech's entire liability....<br />EP: repair or replace<br />EP: ...<br />EP: PROVIDED<br />EP: that the hardware is RETURNED to the point of purchase<br />EP: i think that means u have to haev it<br />EP: lol<br />me: obviously they chose not to take advantage of that clause:)<br />EP: or such other place as logitech may direct<br />me: they directed me explicitly to, i quote<br />me: "do whatever you want with them"<br />me: haha <br />EP: but please<br />EP: u cant warranty an item thats not yours<br />me: but yeah<br />EP: with a little common sens<br />EP: e<br />EP: lol<br />me: i would argue that at that point it was mine, however<br />me: since i had agreed to take it back if it didn't work<br />EP: you have my money?<br />EP: i have the product?<br />EP: lol<br />me: and i asked you if i could leave it in your house until i found a replacement<br />EP: is it REALLY yours?<br />EP: no<br />EP: you wanted to bring the SUBWOOFER back<br />EP: first<br />EP: just to get the serial code<br />EP: right?<br />me: haha yeah, for the serial<br />EP: so u didnt take it back<br />EP: as yours<br />EP: u took it back for the serial<br />me: not physically<br />EP: which dindt happen anyways<br />me: but i took full responsibility back<br />me: otherwise i would've been like<br />me: "you paid, sorry, if i can't get it fixed"<br />me: "you're not getting a refund"<br />EP: lol<br />me: risk and reward...<br />EP: u gave me a word for perfect working condition<br />EP: *your word<br />EP: right?<br />me: yeah<br />me: and when that turned out to be not true<br />me: i offered to fix it or refund your money<br />EP: u did?<br />me: yes, to both parts<br />me: the first part first, the second part as i left<br />EP: o ok<br />EP: by the first part<br />EP: u mean coming to my house<br />EP: right?<br />EP: and looking at it?<br />me: yeah<br />EP: i thought you came to check if i did something wrong<br />me: same difference<br />EP: ure not a hardware mechanic<br />EP: u cnat FIX it<br />EP: if its broken<br />EP: lol<br />EP: can you?<br />me: is there a point?...<br />EP: u came to observe that it really was<br />EP: and i didnt do anything wrong<br />EP: ok<br />EP: everything side<br />EP: *aside<br />EP: what do YOU think<br />EP: we should do<br />me: haha<br />me: i just like arguing with you<br />EP: what would be the biggest room u would give me<br />EP: in terms of EV<br />EP: while still agreeing to it<br />EP: i dont think ive had an arguement like this for half a year<br />EP: it was with alex<br />EP: at irvine<br />EP: we stayed up til like 9am<br />me: haha about what<br />EP: arguing about intangibles<br />EP: life after death<br />me: ah<br />EP: it was really heated tho<br />EP: lol<br />me: people usually get exasperated<br />EP: yes<br />EP: but both of our personalities<br />me: it's definitely a personality quirk<br />EP: dont let down<br />me: haha<br />EP: right?<br />EP: lol<br />EP: just like yours<br />EP: if i may add<br />me: well, actually, if you were to give up and just say "screw it, you can have it all"<br />me: i would immediately relent<br />EP: rofl<br />EP: likewise &gt;)<br />me: although i don't think i'm supposed to say that part.<br />EP: so everything aside<br />EP: what do u want to happen<br />me: hmm well all happiness is relative<br />me: let's say i offered you the z5500's for $200 at this point<br />me: two days ago you would've been like holy shit crazy ok<br />me: but now that just brings the EV split<br />me: oh wait<br />me: what was it before<br />me: 100/75<br />me: yeah brings it down to 150/25<br />me: no longer such a good deal!<br />me: whereas i, on the other hand<br />me: would've been like oh nice $100 extra bucks<br />me: now like, "i should've gotten $175!"<br />me: haha.<br />EP: lol<br />EP: get to the point<br />EP::P<br />EP: get to the verdict<br />me: interjection<br />me: do you NOT want a safe<br />me: or do you just not want to buy a safe<br />EP: i dont want one<br

/>EP: would like to plead guilty<br />me: HAHAHA<br />me: i remember that.<br />EP: total tension breaker<br />EP: rofl<br />EP: that was literally lol<br />me: heh<br />me: all of this is compounded by the fact that i don't NEED NEED the money right now, and i know you don't either<br />me: otherwise it would tip me<br />EP: really?<br />me: what?<br />EP: otherwise it would tip me<br />me: definitely, if i needed the money i'd grab it<br />me: or if you weren't flush<br />me: <br />EP: ...<br />EP: lol<br />me: <br />me: so<br />EP: you work<br />EP: i bet uve made more than me<br />me:

speakers in the first place<br />EP: no im not<br />EP: how?<br />EP: i think YOURE disregarding something<br />EP: not me<br />me: eric<br />EP: my numbers are perfect<br />EP: lol<br />EP: yes?<br

right?<br />me: yes<br />EP: therefore<br />EP: half EV<br />EP: is we both net<br />EP: 88.50<br />EP: correct?<br />EP: from neutral ground<br />EP: correct?<br />EP: my speakers went -100 EV<br />EP: i add that -100 onto my 88.50<br />EP: correct?<br />EP: 188.50<br />EP: which is<br />EP: my money back<br />EP: 150<br />EP: +38.50<br />EP: yes?<br />EP: write in on paper<br />EP: im not wrong<br />me: oh, i agree this time<br />me: so you get<br />me: your money<br />me: $150<br />me: plus the old speakers<br />me: $50<br />EP: +38.50<br />me: and you pay me $12.50<br />EP: no<br />me: <br />EP: u pay me 38.50<br />EP: i dont pay u 12.50<br />me: but you said 188.50<br />EP: it is 188.50<br />EP: which is <br />EP: my money<br />EP: +38.50<br />me: and you get to keep the money, 150<br />me: oh, i seee<br />EP: right?<br />me: ok i agree<br />me: so i keep the new speakers, and the old speakers<br />EP: no<br />me: and you keep $150<br />me: and i pay you<br />EP: i get old speakers too<br />me: $38.50<br />EP: i get old ones too<br />me: the old speakers are $50<br />EP: yes<br />EP: do u remember how i got 188.50?<br />EP: god kalvin please take math<br />EP: 150 valuie on speaker i bought from u<br />EP: they DETIORARTED TO 50<br />EP: -100<br />EP: so i still HAVE the speakers<br />EP: 88.50+100<br />EP: is 188.50<br />EP: speakers in my possession<br />EP: u give me 150+38.50<br />EP: aw make more snese?<br />me: ah, yes<br />EP: see<br />EP: thats what i meant by<br />EP: the danger of lowering their cost<br />EP: too much<br />me: so you get free speakers, and $38<br />EP: ill take them<br />EP: yes<br />EP: thats why<br />me: and i get new speakers<br />EP: u need to put the cost<br />EP: yep<br />EP: isnt that 1/2 EV?<br />me: yep<br />me: so i could've gotten it warranteed on my own, easily<br />me: whereas you couldn't have<br />me: so since i did all the work<br />EP: lol<br />EP: back to square one?<br />me: yup<br />EP: see<br />EP: the problem here<br />EP: is NOT<br />EP: the fact<br />me: there's too many variables<br />EP: that u could have done everything<br />EP: etc.<br />EP: which did NOT take place<br />EP: and shouldnt even be considered<br />EP: no?<br />me: you're right<br />me: we shouldn't consider things<br />me: that didn't happen<br />me: we should consider<br />EP: lol<br />EP: o great<br />EP: now what<br />me: that did happen<br />me: such as<br />me: my getting new speakers<br />me::)<br />EP: lol<br />EP: its under my ownership tho<br />EP::: ure warrantying for me<br />EP: since ur names on teh receipts<br />EP: cuz ure warrantying MY product<br />EP: yea?<br />EP: so im awarding u half EV<br />EP: for warrantying<br />EP: FOR me<br />EP: u get it?<br />EP: lol<br />me: my warranty your product<br />me: got it<br />me: so if we split<br />me: we should split the profits<br />EP: yes<br />EP: even tho product outweighs warranty<br />EP: but sure<br />EP: lol<br />me: so you bought the 680's from me for 150, that exchange involved no profit since you are the owner of the broken 680's<br />EP: we should play more board games puzzle games with each other<br />me: as you pointed out<br />EP: yes<br />EP: that exchange is neutral EV<br />EP: go on<br />me: so now let's split the new speakers<br />me: they're worth 225<br />me: minimum<br />EP: lol<br />EP: no<br />EP: sorry<br />EP: u sold me<br />EP: WORKING speakers<br />EP: for 150<br />EP: not broken ones<br />EP: yea?<br />EP: u have the responsibility to replace them<br />EP: THEN we split<br />EP: the 225<br />EP: so buy me a new subwoof<br />EP: then we can split<br />EP: the 225ish<br />EP: see<br />EP: NOW all the factors are in<br />EP: &gt;)<br />me: that leaves me with 100% of the risk and responsibility and 50% of the reward<br />EP: waitwait<br />EP: when u sell a product<br />EP: and it breaks before first usage<br />EP: u have no risk<br />me: then you take it back<br />EP: but thats not what happened<br />me: since this is all hypothetical, you'd take it back<br />EP: why is any of this<br />EP: hypothetical<br />EP: besides the take it back<br />me: because what actually happened is, i got new speakers warranteed<br />me: what we're discussing is<br />EP: no<br />me: how much of those speakers are yours<br />EP: what actually happened<br />EP: is u used MY warranty<br />EP: to get new speakers<br />me: my warranty, your product<br />me: ok<br />EP: no<br />EP: product comes with warranty<br />EP: no?<br />EP: or ill buy warranty slip from u for additional 5 dollars<br />me: no<br />EP: or however much they sell for<br />me: did you read the manual<br />me: the warranty <br />EP: nontransferrable<br />me: is legally nontransferrable<br />EP: u have no product<br />EP: receipt etc<br />EP: is still mine<br />EP: i just cant warranty<br />me: right<br />EP: no?<br />me: correct, you can't warranty<br />EP: therefore u cant either<br />EP: and with a newfound solution<br />EP: i let u warranty<br />me: perhaps we should just donate the new speakers to charity<br />EP: and we split EV<br />EP: what is wrong<br />EP: with what im saying<br />EP: ure like<br />EP: repelling it so hard<br />EP: lol<br />EP: it makes logical<br />EP: and numerical sense<br />EP: doesnt it?<br />me: we both make sense<br />EP: u wont buy it<br />EP: no u dont!<br />EP: lol<br />me: you didn't need to let me warranty<br />EP: who sells a product<br />EP: without the warranty<br />me: haha<br />EP: honestly<br />me: everyone who sells speakers<br />me: apparently<br />EP: all parts<br />EP: come to me<br />EP: and even so<br />EP: YOU CANT WARRANTY<br />EP: lol<br />EP: but u still DID false advertise<br />EP: right?<br />EP: which ur repsonsibility<br />EP: to replace<br />me: yeah, so i'll refund your money <br />EP: and we split the BONUS<br />me: or replace it<br />EP: get it?<br />EP: ok<br />EP: u can refund me 150<br />EP: and split the 225<br />EP: thats fine with me<br />me: when i took the serial number, that was implicit acceptance of taking back the product to get a replacement<br />EP: or 275<br />EP: or whatever it is<br />EP: yes<br />EP: and as you left the door<br />EP: words from ur mouth<br />EP: were<br />EP: maybe we will get lucky<br />me: haha quite true<br />EP: and you can have the new one<br />EP: and id keep the old ones<br />EP: thats more than implicit<br />EP: so "yi yen wai ding"<br />EP: lol<br />EP: one phrase sets the pace?<br />EP: i cant think of a better translation<br />EP: so whats the problem here<br />EP: ure already getting whatever EV<br />EP: be happy<br />EP: lol<br />EP: we are both getting plus<br />EP: i dont understand why u think of things<br />EP: as what COULD have been<br />EP: just think of what it is<br />me: that's exactly<br />EP: and take half EV<br />me: what i'd say to you<br />me: haha<br />EP: but the new speakers u ordered<br />EP: dont belong to you!<br />EP: technically everything regarding the product<br />EP: belongs to me<br />me: except the warranty<br />EP: if u cant warranty for me<br />EP: that sucks<br />me: which i used<br />EP: but the warranty isnt yours<br />me: and logitech gave me<br />EP: and u cant use it<br />me: it is mine legally; you're right, i shouldn't be able to usee it<br />me: but logitech DID let me use it<br />EP: did u tell them?<br />me: that's why i think of it as what is<br />EP: that it was yours?<br />EP: the productu sold already?<br />EP: did u say the product was no longer in ur possession<br />me: he specifically said<br />me: "you can do whatever you want"<br />EP: that means<br />me: with the broken speakers<br />EP: theres implicit assumption<br />EP: that the old ones belong to you<br />me: no<br />EP: if you can do whatever u want <br />EP: yes<br />me: that they belonged to me<br />me: when they broke<br />me: which is what i called for<br />EP: lol<br />EP: no<br />EP: sorry<br />EP: things dont work that way<br />EP: they were broken<br />EP: and then i lost them<br />EP: im calling them in now<br />EP: for warranty<br />EP: sorry<br />EP: that doesnt work<br />EP: if u get third line me<br />me: yeah<br />EP: and ask logitech<br />EP: if that works<br />EP: fine<br />EP: but when u sell a product<br />me: so if instead<br />EP: YOU TOLD ME<br />me: i sold them tomorrow<br />EP: NOTHING ELSE<br />me: i'd be fine<br />EP: CAME WITH THE PRODUCT<br />EP: i asked u<br />EP: correct?<br />EP: therefore<br />EP: all items<br />EP: with the product<br />EP: are mine<br />me: except that legally the warranty can't be.<br />me: which, ok, is another misrepresentation of the product<br />EP: if the warranty cant legally be mine<br />EP: then u cant legally get a new set with out the product<br />me: this is going to make the top position on my im length list<br />me: i can feel it<br />EP: ure losing<br />EP: whichever way we look at it<br />EP: lol<br />EP: sorry<br />EP: lets get the facts in first<br />me: nope, logitech never made me verify<br />EP: then we can hypothetical all we want<br />EP: thats great<br />me: that i still had the speakers<br />me: since it's their discretion to do so<br />EP: but its part of the warranty thing<br />me: the warranty says<br />EP: no<br />EP: see<br />EP: tahts where ure wrong<br />EP: all things attached to the item<br />EP: are mine<br />EP: now<br />EP: i can not warranty<br />EP: anymore<br />EP: because u did<br />EP: i dont even have the option to try<br />EP: because ur serial number is taken<br />EP: maybe they wont use discretion on my part either<br />EP: and find out its transferreed<br />EP: u took away form my product<br />EP: none of it<br />EP: is yours<br />EP: no?<br />EP: u technically<br />EP: get 0 EV<br />EP: did i not ask you<br />EP: if anything else with the product<br />EP: right?<br />me: yeah<br />me: so i was wrong<br />EP: and u added<br />EP: at the end<br />me: and i'll either replace your product, or give you back your money?<br />EP: ud send it to me<br />EP: the wires<br />EP: or i can pick them up later<br />EP: if i find the stuff<br />EP: meaning<br />EP: all the stuff<br />EP: is still mine<br />EP: no<br />EP: cuz hte product u sold me<br />EP: is one that has a warranty on it<br />EP: because apparently it did<br />me: that product doesn't exist<br />me: there's no product that has a transferable warranty<br />EP: thats logitechs discrepancy<br />EP: just like u said<br />EP: they make mistakes<br />EP: like in ur case<br />EP: but however we look at it<br />EP: the warranty<br />EP: is either mine<br />EP: or its noones<br />EP: it is NEVER<br />EP: yours<br />EP: u have no product<br />EP: thats fact<br />EP: ok now im sleeping in 10 minutes<br />EP: i have to wake up early tomororw<br />EP: to pickup percy<br />EP: form the airport<br />EP: but if u dont think what ive said is fair<br />EP: do what i did<br />EP: third party ask<br />EP: and show me<br />EP: thats what i did<br />EP: cuz i didnt trust myself<br />EP: even tho i thought it was unfair<br />EP: reinforced learning yea?<br />EP: it would help ur arguements too<br />EP: if u got backing<br />EP: lol<br />me: i did<br />EP: please show<br />me: i did<br />EP: ?<br />EP: whod u ask<br />EP: u showed me noone<br />me: yes, i did<br />me: i pasted it<br />EP: no<br />EP: i must have dced then<br />EP: i never saw it<br />me: let me find it<br />EP: repaste<br />me: me: i think this was one of the best reasoned responses i got<br />me: x: i dont think that either of the arguments/ways to resolve the situation are the way to go<br />x: it seems to me that A wouldn't have known the speakers were broken unless B had purchased them and stuff<br />x: A could have sold them via ebay, and then dealt with an external unhappy 3rd party<br />x: so it seems B deserves some credit&nbsp; for finding the broken-ness<br />x: still, it seems to "cheat" A to say that B owns the speakers, the new ones, as without A, B probably wouldn't have been able to get a replacement<br />x: because of the receipts/orig. purchaser stuff<br />x: i would think that perhaps some monetary compromise is in order... if i were buying the speakers in question, i would find a $75 increase very hard to stomach<br /><br />EP: k<br />EP: well<br />EP: i told u that the old ones<br />EP: we missed a volume switch right?<br />me: k<br />EP: OO<br />EP: i thought x was YOU<br />me: no<br />EP: where are u showing me the wording<br />EP: of the question<br />EP: i showed YOU right?<br />me: k<br />me: me: i will not reveal who i in this scenario<br />me: so whatever you might think, don't reveal it<br />me: so person A&nbsp; buys speakers a little over a year ago<br />me: A uses them for a bit, then puts them into storage for several months <br />me: prior to being put into storage, they function perfectly<br />me: A finds a buyer, person B <br />me: person B purchases the speakers and finds that they have an unrepairable problem; one speaker is broken<br />me: despite A's assurances that the speakers worked fine<br />me: so B returns to A and informs him of the problem<br />me: A can't fix them and decides to try to get a replacement, promising to refund all the money paid if he fails<br />me: A calls the company and finds that they're still under warranty<br />me: since the company no longer carries that model, it provides a newer model <br />me: which it will ship to A's house, since A is the original purchaser and has the receipt<br />me: now, the question is, does A have the obligation to provide these new speakers to B at the same, substantially cheaper price as the original speakers<br />me: or is he only obligated to refund the money originally paid, since the speakers were faulty<br />me: discuss.<br />me: entirety.<br />EP: wtf<br />EP: is x ?<br />me: haha oh man<br />me: no<br />EP: really?<br />me: not even close.<br />EP: wow<br />EP: it sounds like her writing<br />EP: tone of voice<br />EP: but theres no periods at the end<br />EP: wow<br />EP: i dont know anyone that talks like that<br />me: so<br />me: ?<br />EP: ok<br />EP: so u left out something<br />EP: u keep the old ones<br />EP: u cant miss that<br />EP: lol<br />EP: if the old ones we send back<br />EP: then<br />EP: we have something to talk about<br />EP: cuz thats 50 EV<br />EP: and we have a 75 EV value difference<br />EP: and how many peopel did u ask<br />EP: cuz thats a big factor<br />EP: the old ones<br />EP: cuz u said that was one of the BETTER responses<br />me: the old ones don't matter; i refund your money and you give me back the old ones<br />me: that would not have affected his response in any way<br />EP: sure, but then we split the profit<br />me: read his response<br />me: i said that was one of the better reasoned responses<br />me: as opposed to one line "yes no"<br />EP: x: still, it seems to "cheat" A to say that B owns the speakers, the new ones, as without A, B probably wouldn't have been able to get a replacement<br />x: because of the receipts/orig. purchaser stuff<br />EP: yea?<br />EP: so B deserves some credit right?<br />me: yes<br />EP: isnt that what his entire arguement<br />EP: is implying<br />me: yes<br />EP: ?<br />EP: so what we are doing here<br />EP: is that you are giving me a replacement<br />me: so x advises<br />EP: for my old ones<br />EP: which is neutral EV<br />EP: and then as part of my credit<br />EP: we split EV<br />me: that we come to a monetary compromise<br />EP: because person x<br />EP: does not know<br />EP: u are reimbursing me<br />EP: for the other one<br />me: between the $225 i would like <br />EP: o wait<br />me: and the $150 you would like<br />EP: ure right then<br />EP: so basically<br />me: and you've already paid<br />EP: the other speakers<br />EP: are a tossout<br />me: no<br />EP: u owe me a product<br />EP: yes<br />EP: warranty<br />EP: they are gone<br />EP: you owe me another product<br />EP: by ur defintion<br />EP: it costs 75 more<br />EP: ill pay it<br />EP: i get both systems<br />me: yes, i owe you another product, and you owe me the original broken speakers<br />EP: why?<br />me: because when you return something for being broken<br />EP: not according to logitech huh?<br />me: the original seller has the right to demand the broken item in exchange for the replacement<br />me: no, not according to logitech<br />EP: well<br />EP: i guess<br />EP: i get to keep them?<br />EP: so anyways<br />EP: even if i werent<br />EP: where exactly<br />EP: is my monetary benefactory<br />EP: ?<br />EP: that was some bad english<br />me: hehe<br />EP: see<br />EP: this is why<br />EP: im willing to SPLIT<br />EP: the EV<br />me: i'm willing to split our differences<br />me: the way you calculate EV<br />EP: whats wrong wtih it<br />EP: its numbers<br />EP: cant be wrong<br />EP: lol<br />me: it presumes that i got nothing <br />me: basically<br />EP: because<br />me: because right now<br />EP: you DO HAVE NOTHING<br />EP: !?!?!<br />me: no<br />EP: u sold me<br />EP: the product<br />EP: and everything wtih it<br />EP: you HAVE NOTHING<br />EP: lol<br />me: i called logitech, and they gave me something<br />me: haha<br />EP: well its not meant for you<br />me: ahahahaha<br />EP: ok but all in all<br />EP: verbal contracts binding?<br />EP: i get to keep new ones?<br />EP: lol<br />EP: how many ways<br />me: verbal contracts are binding<br />EP: do i have to beat u<br />EP: lol<br />me: offhand remarks made in a humorous tone are not<br />me: such as<br />me: "man, if i win the lottery, i'm giving half to you"<br />EP: woahwoahwoah<br />EP: holdup<br />EP: you said<br />EP: ok<br />EP: so im going to warranty these<br />EP: and they will send a new z680<br />EP: and u can have even a newer one<br />me: yes<br />EP: for the same price<br />EP: and if we get LUCKY<br />EP: they dont have it anymore<br />EP: and u get a brand new z5500<br />EP: and i get to keep<br />EP: the old system<br />EP: btw<br />EP: from ur other ppl<br />EP: how many yes/nos<br />me: that was said in jest both in tone and expression...obviously i wasn't expecting that to happen, and i said it offhand as i laughed out the door<br />EP: lol<br />EP: why are u like this<br />EP: i dont get it<br />EP: ure fighting for somethign thats not yours<br />EP: as big of a share as u can get<br />EP: because technically<br />EP: what should happen<br />EP: by all laws<br />EP: nontrasnferable warranty<br />EP: u either<br />EP: go out and get me a z680<br />EP: or u give me 150<br />EP: and take the stuff back<br />EP: thats what happens<br />EP: and its 0<br />EP: but<br />EP: since we have bonus<br />me: ...<br />EP: we split EV<br />EP: no?<br />me: "we have bonus" is the contentious part<br />EP: thats being GENREOUS<br />EP: isnt it?<br />me: no<br />EP: ok<br />me: i would argue<br />EP: first<br />EP: the bonus<br />me: "i have bous"<br />EP: is noones<br />me: er, bonus.<br />EP: u have no product<br />me: i didn't need the product; they told me to do whatever i wanted to with the product; i had already done that.<br />me: it really comes down to, who deserves this extra luck? and no one can say<br />me: and both of us are biased in favor of ourselves<br />me: and i agree you have the stronger argument on the face of it-- if it were to be summarized into a few lines-- but i think that considering all the details, it's not<br />me: well, eric<br />me: thank you for an interesting conversation<br />me: a rather unique experience i must say<br />me: i will give you the z5500's<br />me: for the price you paid<br />me: and i'll take back the 680's and the wires<br />me: and you'll have gotten 5500's for $150<br />me: approximately $150 off the street price<br />me: aren't you glad we're friends<br />me: ;)<br />me: 'night!<br />EP: rofl<br />EP: goodnight<br /><br />3 AM. The debate concludes.<br /><br /><br />(Oh, and did you know there's a 64KB limit on LJ entries? Me neither. What's that? You hate me for making you scroll 9 times farther down your friends page? oh... sorry. O:))<br /><br />On another note, I always found the attitude of many Saratogans toward making money rather interesting. I remember many, many people saying that if I made a profit by selling a $20 item I had bought for $10 to someone for $15, then I was-- obviously!-- cheating their notions of fairness. Even if the buyer was happy to pay the $15, I was still ripping off the buyer. I spent my sophomore summer reselling goods on ebay, and the same summer listening to comments like "Oh, isn't that ripping people off?" Even now I find that some people still have those same notions-- money isn't money to them, it's simply a nice abstract concept that should be shared fairly and evenly, and God forbid someone profit more than the other from a mutually beneficial transaction! Gosh, now I feel like a sarcastic Republican... ew.<br /><br />Anyway.

People who get tired of arguing about something important and say something like "whatever, I don't care, have it your way." I don't just want it my way. I want you to believe in my way. <br /><br />Then there's Eric at the other extreme... <br /><br />(Short version: I argued with Eric over whether he deserved a disputed $75 windfall due to Logitech's unexpectedly generous speaker warranty policy. I let Eric have the $75 in the end... but not before we had a four-hour debate. I'm still right, though. So is being taken advantage of OK if I accept it over the alternative? If push came to shove, would you piss someone off for $75? Let me know.)<br /><br /><a name="cutid1"></a><br />8 PM. The debate begins.<br /><br />EP: u there?<br />me: hey<br />me: yeah<br />EP: i thought at first<br />EP: it was just me<br />me: what?<br />EP: but i have to show u something<br />EP wants to directly connect . <br />EP is now directly connected . <br />EP: EP: hm<br />EP: ok<br />EP: i have a question to ask u<br />EP: lol<br />EP: u have to be paying attention<br />ddddd: ok go<br />EP: ok<br />EP: if person A and person B are friends<br />EP: ok<br />EP: person buys a product from a store<br />EP: *person A<br />EP: he doesnt really need it<br />EP: so he sells it to person B<br />EP: for a pretty good price<br />EP: following so far?<br />ddddd: y<br />EP: percy B figures out the product is faulty<br />EP: once he buys it<br />EP: it doenst work properly<br />EP: erm<br />EP: *person<br />EP: not percy<br />EP: person A isnt even percy<br />EP: i dunno how that slipped out<br />EP: none of them are percy<br />EP: rofl<br />EP: ok so B buys the product<br />EP: finds out its faulty<br />EP: and asks A to take a look at it<br />ddddd: k<br />EP: so A figures out<br />EP: that the product is faulty<br />EP: so contacts the store<br />EP: and they warranty it<br />EP: but they dont have that model anymore<br />EP: just a newer one<br />EP: so they send the newer one free of charge to person A<br />EP: and he gets to keep the broken one too<br />EP: so the broken one isnt perfect<br />EP: but its still fine<br />EP: u know?<br />EP: so basically<br />EP: the newer one<br />EP: on the market<br />EP: costs 75 bucks more than the first one<br />EP: so what should happen here<br />EP: honestly what do u think should be the correct course of action<br />EP: or all the fair options<br />ddddd: umm<br />ddddd: well<br />EP: i hope i dindt sound biased towards any side<br />EP: lol<br />EP: cuz one of them obviously is me<br />ddddd: i think person B should get to keep everything<br />ddddd: cuz he bought it<br />ddddd: so its his<br />ddddd: but if he wants to be nice<br />ddddd: he'd let person a have teh old one or something<br />ddddd: bbl<br />EP: tell me when ure back<br />EP: ok<br />EP: ure back right?<br />ddddd: i think the stuff technically belongs to B<br />EP: so person A was me<br />EP: so u think its the most fair<br />ddddd: lol<br />EP: if i give it to B?<br />ddddd: yea<br />EP: k<br />ddddd: cuz it's his<br />EP: is percy there<br />rrrrr: yea<br />EP: tell him to sign on<br />EP: haha<br />rrrrr: we leave in 45 min<br />EP: o<br />EP: for airport?<br />rrrrr: yea<br />EP: k<br />rrrrr: this is percy<br />rrrrr: what<br />EP: question<br />EP: honestly replay<br />EP: *reply<br />EP: if person A and person B are friends<br />EP: ok<br />EP: person buys a product from a store<br />EP: *person A<br />EP: he doesnt really need it<br />EP: so he sells it to person B<br />EP: for a pretty good price<br />EP: following so far?<br />rrrrr: shoot<br />EP: ok so B buys the product<br />EP: finds out its faulty<br />EP: and asks A to take a look at it<br />EP: so A figures out<br />EP: that the product is faulty<br />EP: so contacts the store<br />EP: and they warranty it<br />EP: but they dont have that model anymore<br />EP: just a newer one<br />EP: so they send the newer one free of charge to person A<br />EP: and he gets to keep the broken one too<br />EP: so the broken one isnt perfect<br />EP: but its still fine<br />EP: u know?<br />EP: so basically<br />EP: the newer one<br />EP: on the market<br />EP: costs 75 bucks more than the first one<br />EP: so what should happen here<br />EP: honestly what do u think should be the correct course of action<br />EP: or all the fair options<br />Previous message was not received by rrrrr because of error: Your message was refused by the AOL Instant Messenger server, probably because the message was too big. Try making the message shorter and send it again.<br /><br />EP wants to directly connect . <br />rrrrr is now directly connected . <br />EP: so A figures out<br />EP: that the product is faulty<br />EP: so contacts the store<br />EP: and they warranty it<br />EP: but they dont have that model anymore<br />EP: just a newer one<br />EP: so they send the newer one free of charge to person A<br />EP: and he gets to keep the broken one too<br />EP: so the broken one isnt perfect<br />EP: but its still fine<br />EP: u know?<br />EP: so basically<br />EP: the newer one<br />EP: on the market<br />EP: costs 75 bucks more than the first one<br />EP: so what should happen here<br />EP: honestly what do u think should be the correct course of action<br />EP: or all the fair options<br />rrrrr: how are you talking to youself<br />rrrrr: anyways go on<br />EP: ?<br />EP: its done<br />EP: did u not get the whole thing?<br />rrrrr: i got it<br />rrrrr: i guess it was loading<br />EP: well?<br />rrrrr: i guess if person A doesn't really need it, then person B can take the new one<br />rrrrr: and if person A wants it he can have the bnroken one<br />EP: so thats the fairest course of action u can think of?<br />rrrrr: fairest?<br />EP: yea<br />EP: most fair<br />EP: lol<br />rrrrr: yeah if they are friends<br />rrrrr: seems fair to me<br />EP: so what about the 75 difference<br />rrrrr: what about it<br />rrrrr: person B wanted a product<br />rrrrr: it was faulty, they send new one<br />rrrrr: person B needed it anyways<br />rrrrr: person A doesn't really need it<br />rrrrr: but he gets money and a broken one<br />rrrrr: person B gets a better product for 75 less<br />rrrrr: both people still win <br />EP: ok from the context<br />EP: which one i<br />EP: im one of them<br />EP: best guess<br />rrrrr: i dunno where the problem is<br />EP: im just curious<br />EP: which one is me<br />rrrrr: it'd help if i knew more but... i guess ill guess the buyer<br />EP: which is me<br />rrrrr: from what you said it could be either though<br />EP: im curious<br />rrrrr: the buyer<br />rrrrr: wait<br />EP: i pasted some stuff from the first one to ask the second person<br />EP: so i didnt have to retype<br />EP: but thats unedited<br />EP: and i dunno<br />EP: i just dont think its really fair<br />me: wow, that was intricate<br />EP: like<br />EP: i really wasnt sure<br />EP: if i was biased<br />EP: so i asked 2 ppl<br />EP: and i told one i was A<br /><br />EP: and one i was B<br />EP: basically<br />EP: i dunno<br />me: i agree that i don't "need" it, just like i don't "need" $75<br />me: if you'd like, i can get additional opinions<br />me: and i can get them to agree with person x<br />me: that it's fair this way as well<br />me: well<br />me: maybe i'm wrong and i can't<br />me: let me try:)<br />EP: u dont think i worded it fairly?<br />EP: lol<br />me: no, you did<br />me: i can word it differently<br />EP: ok<br />me: and just as fairly:)<br />me: ok<br />EP: because yea<br />me: heh only you eric<br />me: but i'll try... one sec<br />EP direct connection is closed . <br />me: haha hey<br />EP: ok<br />EP: yea?<br />me: is alex ok, or have you talked to him<br />EP: alex is ok, but he might already know who A and B is<br />EP: cuz i told him i was getting speakers from u<br />me: hahahahahahaha<br />me: k nm<br />EP: a while ago<br />EP: did u ask him?<br />EP: lol<br />EP: *already<br />me: nope<br />EP: o ok<br />EP: i was gonna say if u did<br />EP: id still like to read it<br />EP: lol<br />EP: but PREFERABLY someone other than alex<br />EP: but even ppl i dont know<br />EP: its fine<br />me: haha k<br />EP: if u can word it somehow<br />EP: so he deosnt know<br />EP: lol<br />EP: thats fine with me<br />me: nah<br />EP: but i dont know if ud WANT to ask alex<br />EP: i think hes more biased towards me &gt;)<br />EP: hahahaha<br />EP: we ARE roommates<br />EP: lol<br />EP: but basically<br />EP: u dont really have to show me anything<br />EP: if you honestly think its fair<br />EP: then i cant argue<br />EP: lol<br />me: well, i'm kind of curious<br />me: i don't really think there's a right answer for what should be done<br />EP: well<br />EP: tahts why i asked<br />EP: haha<br />EP: cuz i felt my answer was kinda biased<br />EP: and theres no set way<br />EP: i guess it feels like<br />EP: you get 75 more than u asked for<br />EP: plus the old system<br />EP: is not exactly fair<br />EP: i mean<br />EP: at first when u called logitech<br />EP: and u told me<br />EP: it was 75 more<br />EP: i thought logitech charged u 75 more<br />EP: for the newer system<br />EP: cuz it was the market price difference<br />EP: and i was like <br />EP: i guess fine<br />EP: i can pay for that<br />me: right<br />me: it's definitely one of those<br />me: i COULD have won the lottery<br />me: but i didn't<br />me: feelings<br />me: and to me, of course, since i'm biased, it feels like<br />me: i could have opened the box before you came and set them up like i had planned to<br />me: found it was broken, told you sorry, and warranteed it.<br />EP: i know<br />EP: thats why i thought<br />EP: technically when u warranty both systems are mine<br />EP: but at my house<br />EP: u said i could have new one<br />EP: and u could keep the old one<br />EP: minus one speaker<br />EP: and i was like ok sure<br />EP: cuz when u sell me a product<br />EP: the warranty is mine right...?<br />EP: even tho u did do the work<br />me: that's a good question actually... i don't know<br />EP: like this feels really stupid getting an arguement over<br />EP: but i know how u feel<br />EP: but u understand my side too right?<br />me: oh no i'm not annoyed or anything<br />me: hope you're not either<br />me: yeah<br />me: so<br />me: i think this was one of the best reasoned responses i got<br />me: x: i dont think that either of the arguments/ways to resolve the situation are the way to go<br />x: it seems to me that A wouldn't have known the speakers were broken unless B had purchased them and stuff<br />x: A could have sold them via ebay, and then dealt with an external unhappy 3rd party<br />x: so it seems B deserves some credit&nbsp; for finding the broken-ness<br />x: still, it seems to "cheat" A to say that B owns the speakers, the new ones, as without A, B probably wouldn't have been able to get a replacement<br />x: because of the receipts/orig. purchaser stuff<br />x: i would think that perhaps some monetary compromise is in order... if i were buying the speakers in question, i would find a $75 increase very hard to stomach<br /><br />EP: k<br />EP: well<br />EP: i told u that the old ones<br />EP: we missed a volume switch right?<br />EP: so everythings still perfect<br />me: yeah you did<br />EP: in terms of sound<br />EP: i nearly popped my eardrums finding out<br />me: ... it's just missing one of the front two speakers<br />me: haha<br />EP: but anyways<br />EP: u dont think its fair if i get new while u get old?<br />EP: i mean im still paying 150<br />EP: and ure getting the old set free<br />EP: i guess<br />EP: if 150 was equal to ur new set's cost<br />EP: erm old<br />EP: see how i saw the warranty situation is<br />EP: not something really to be gained from<br />EP: but since logitech sells u a product<br />EP: that doenst work<br />EP: its their responsibility<br />EP: to <br />EP: replace it<br />EP: with one that works right?<br />EP: but then<br />EP: it just happens<br />EP: that they dont have this model<br />EP: and like wise<br />EP: it seems like<br />EP: since u sold me something that doenst work<br />EP: its ur responsibility to do the same?<br />EP: if that makes sense<br />me: yeah<br />me: so i should replace it with what i promised<br />me: by your logic:p<br />EP: lol<br />me: haha well<br />EP: ok<br />EP: but honestly<br />EP: if u went out<br />EP: and bought a 680<br />EP: and gave it to me<br />EP: i think thats just ridiculous<br />EP: lol<br />EP: i mean<br />EP: its totally unecessary<br />EP: its a third speaker system<br />me: haha yeah<br />EP: and we end as a whole<br />EP: losing money<br />me: haha no<br />EP: in terms of shipping<br />EP: etc<br />me: actually, no<br />me: we'd both hurt ourselves, but we wouldn't lose money<br />EP: well<br />EP: we hurt ourselves by losing money?<br />EP: lol<br />me: ok this is a fun debate i will continue later<br />EP: no?<br />me: sorry gg<br />me: no<br />EP: ok<br />EP: holdup<br />EP: the 5500 speakers<br />EP: are 6 foot cables right?<br />EP: or are they longer<br />me: dunno<br />me: sorry<br />me: bye<br />EP: ok<br />me: oh<br />EP: i guess we can continue at a later date<br />me: they're not speaker cables though<br />EP: hey<br /><br />Auto response from me: bbl<br /><br />EP: i just thought of something<br />EP: u know whats the best idea<br />EP: lol<br />EP: write a copy of what happened<br />EP: show it to me<br />EP: if i think its fiar<br />EP: put it on ur lj<br />EP: and poll it<br />EP: leaving all sorts of combinations of results<br />EP: and we ONLY decide<br />EP: if any of the choices<br />EP: is over 75%<br />EP: but otherwsie serves as guideline<br />EP: at least 25 votes<br />EP: and u can track ips right<br />EP: so no same voting<br />EP: lol<br />EP: or u could have ppl just leave comments<br />EP: instead of poll<br />EP: cuz i only asked 2 ppl<br />EP: and i showed it to u<br />EP: otherwise<br />EP: 50/50 it in terms of monetary advantage<br />EP: price the old speakers at a cost<br />EP: see how much i should gain from this<br />EP: and how much u should<br />EP is away at 9:26:00. <br />EP returned at 12:13:42. <br />EP: so<br />EP: how long for the shipping<br />me: a couple weeks<br />EP: so<br />EP: how exactly<br />EP: are we going to reach our conclusion<br />EP: lol<br />me: it basically comes down to<br />me: i got lucky<br />me: how much luck should i share with you<br />me: where luck<br />me: is actually money<br />me::)<br />EP: lol<br />me: obviously if i'd gotten 680's as replacements<br />me: there'd be no issues:)<br />EP: u really see it that way huh<br />EP: lol<br />me: no? <br />EP: i already told u my view, no?<br />me: how do they contradict what i just said?<br />me: "if i'd gotten 680's"<br />me: "there'd be no issue"<br />EP: nono<br />me: isn't that true<br />EP: not that<br />EP: the top part<br />EP: before that<br />me: the top part is the logical conclusion to the bottom<br />me: so i got 5500's instead of 680's, which was lucky<br />EP: me: it basically comes down to<br />me: i got lucky<br />me: how much luck should i share with you<br />EP: thats the part<br />EP: that i said i didnt share the same view<br />me: how so<br />EP: let me ask you something<br />EP: lessay i buy a computer<br />EP: i sell it to a third party<br />EP: through ebay<br />EP: on the other side of the world<br />EP: dont u send the warranty?<br />EP: lool<br />EP: do you seriously keep the warranty<br />EP: or were u planning on telling me<br />EP: taht u didnt sell the warranty to me<br />EP: ok<br />EP: so lessay another scenario<br />EP: i buy it<br />EP: i never use it<br />EP: i never find out its broken<br />EP: its not your loss right?<br />EP: cuz our stuff is done<br />EP: u got 150 for ur system<br />EP: and i paid 150 for a systen<br />EP: that i dont use<br />EP: so what i dont understand<br />EP: is how you are lucky<br />EP: if you see what i mean<br />EP: i honestly think<br />EP: by all TECHNICALITIES<br />EP: even tho<br />EP: thats not the way we do things<br />EP: our stuff is done. and youre bascially warrantying it for me<br />EP: no?<br />me: mm, the last one-- an equally valid scenario: i test the speakers. i warranty the speakers. i sell you the newly fixed speakers. it didn't happen... but neither did your "keep it and not use it ever" scenario<br />EP: so i guess if i piad you for hte "time" and effort it took to warranty<br />me: yeah, i see<br />EP: yes but my scenario<br />EP: is just trying to show u<br />me: so i guess we have two options<br />EP: ok umm<br />EP: i lost connection<br />EP: for like 5 minutes<br />me: technicalities<br />EP: so this is the last thing i have on my screen<br />me: no i didn't say anything<br />EP: <br />EP: of transactions<br />EP: k<br />me: technicalities<br />me: or "feelings"<br />me: should we use the techical result then?<br />EP: huh?<br />EP: the techical result?<br />me: your argument<br />EP: yes what about it?<br />me: which is that technically, the warranty is yours, so you should get the replacement<br />EP: ok..?<br />me: so do you want to decide it by the warranty<br />me: or would that not be enough<br />EP: i dont understand<br />EP: what ure trying to get at<br />me: let's say the warranty isn't transferable <br />EP: ok<br />EP: lol<br />me: would you then conclude, oh, the warranty was yours, never mind?<br />EP: see<br />EP: ok<br />EP: how much is the set that i have worth?<br />EP: 100?<br />me: legally nontransferable<br />EP: is it about 100?<br />EP: put a tag on it<br />me: i would say so... it depends on the buyer, but 100 is reasonable<br />EP: ok<br />EP: so if we tag it at 100<br />EP: u giving me the new one<br />EP: i get +75 EV<br />me: <br />EP: u get old one<br />EP: youre getting +100 EV<br />me: <br />me:&nbsp; )<br />EP: so EVEN tho the warranty is "mine"<br />EP: ure getting 100, no?<br />EP: more than me<br />EP: lol<br />EP: well ok<br />EP: what i meant by technicalities<br />EP: was that<br />EP: in the court of law<br />EP: im PRETTY sure<br />EP: id get both?<br />EP: lol<br />me: ok<br />me: so if it turns out<br />me: that in a court of law<br />me: the warranty would not have been transferred<br />EP: thats why i say we dont do things that way<br />EP: ok<br />me: haha ok<br />EP: then i guess<br />EP: u hold the warranty<br />EP: i hold the product<br />EP: you lose a possible +100 EV<br />EP: i lose a possible +75 VE<br />EP: lol<br />EP: no?<br />EP: we hurt each other<br />me: nope, i'd still have the new set.<br />EP: lol<br />EP: you CANT warranty a set thats not yours<br />EP: ....<br />me: if the warranty were nontransferable and stayed with me<br />me: then yes<br />EP: ok is the warranty online<br />me: as long as i fulfill the obligations that logitech sets out&nbsp; <br />EP: i pretty damn sure<br />EP: that if ure no longeri n possession of the item<br />EP: u may not warranty it<br />me: hahaa<br />EP: otherwise u could lose the item and warranty it<br />EP: rofl<br />me: too bad neither of us are lawyers<br />EP: lol<br />EP: u really think u can warranty an item<br />EP: that u dont have possession of?<br />EP: but see<br />me: haha<br />EP: i dont understand WHY you want split<br />EP: the benefit<br />EP: in a way<br />EP: thats already<br />EP: benefiting you MORE than me<br />EP: especailyl when i honestly believe<br />EP: that TECHNICALLY<br />EP: you shouldnt be getting anything<br />EP: ok<br />EP: post on lj<br />EP: ur lj<br />EP: lol<br />me: alright let's trace it<br />EP: vote <br />me: haha nah<br />EP: i honestly cant see<br />EP: ppl agreeing with u<br />EP: even 1 or 2<br />EP: get 2 extreme ppl<br />EP: i showed u the ONLY 2 ppl i asked<br />me: so let's say, then<br />EP: now yes thats my wordo f honor<br />EP: i didnt selectively show<br />me: i believe you<br />me: i do<br />EP: so ok, in this whole scheme<br />EP: together<br />me: so let's say i can't warranty a product without it physically here<br />EP: we net 175 EV<br />EP: how muhc<br />EP: did u plan on giving me<br />EP: since thats about our conclusion<br />EP: assuming its yours to give of course<br />EP::P<br />me: well, actually<br />me: i hate to correct you on this <br />me: oh, i see<br />me: b/c the est. value of the 680's dropped<br />EP: yes<br />EP: i mean<br />EP: how much less than 75<br />EP: were u planning on giving me<br />EP: its not like youre getting shafted<br />EP: ure netting 100<br />EP: no?<br />me: hehe it depends on how far we go back<br />me: prior to buying the speakers, we were "even"<br />EP: yes<br />me: once you bought them, you were paying $150 for something you would have paid $200 for on the next cheapest outlet, ebay<br />EP: factor in the used + the fact that its costing u the same cuz ure sending shipping<br />EP: and if u want the cables<br />EP: i can give them back<br />me: ignore the cables for now<br />EP: ok<br />EP: but for a used system on ebay<br />me: hm... true<br />EP: its under 150<br />EP: and the 50 shipping<br />EP: is just being transferred<br />EP: as me paying the postage<br />EP: u dont really net anything more right?<br />EP: u have to pay 50 to ship<br />EP: and charge someone 50<br />me: yes, it would have benefited you and not benefited me&nbsp; <br />EP: why should i have to pay shipping if i drive and pickup the item anyways right?<br />EP: shipping cost is to a third party for a service<br />me: how would you have avoided the shipping cost?<br />EP: i cant<br />me: so $125 for $150 value<br />me: sorry<br />EP: i decide if an extra 50 is worth it<br />EP: or i switch models<br />me: $150 for $175<br />EP: how are yo ugetting 175<br />me: 125 + 50 shipping<br />EP: i showed u on ebay<br />EP: 150+50 <br />EP: is brand new right<br />EP: buyit now price from store<br />EP: or was it 140+50<br />me: yeah... there's some new ones going for 145+50<br />EP: yea<br />EP: i think the biggest thing right now for me<br />EP: is that by giving u the older system<br />EP: and keeping hte new one<br />EP: i already feel like im doing u a facor<br />EP: *favor<br />EP: lol<br />EP: so for me to add on<br />EP: really sounds not possible<br />EP: like both mathematically<br />EP: and technically in the court of law<br />EP: lol<br />EP: i dont see how youre unhappy with<br />EP: u know<br />EP: how u gave me this system<br />EP: ure getting every piece back<br />EP: all ure getting<br />EP: is a net of 150 dollars<br />EP: lol<br />EP: nothing is happeneing<br />EP: ure keeping the same system<br />EP: that u gave me<br />EP: even tho we know its broken<br />EP: so its value is down<br />EP: ure free rolling 150<br />EP: - whatever less its worth<br />EP: if i came to your house<br />EP: and i crushed your system<br />EP: in accident<br />EP: id pay u 150<br />EP: right?<br />EP: not 150+225<br />EP: lol<br />EP: theres no jackpot to be hit<br />EP: lol<br />EP: when u warranty something<br />EP: ure not SUPPOSED to gain<br />EP: ure supposed to come back to neutral EV<br />me: except i just did<br />me: i think the biggest thing right now for me, is that by selling you the new one, i'm already doing you a favor, by saving you $50 and the risk of buying off ebay, or $75 buying offazon; and if i had remembered to check if the speakers were working, this wouldn't even matter; and this is still, i think, about whether i should share my luck, since the warranty is nontransferable apparently <br />me: also, i'm still not annoyed, if i sound like i.<br />me: if i'd bought a lottery ticket that you caused me to buy&nbsp; all your hypothetical scenarios would still be in effect-- if it wasn't for you i wouldn't have won<br />me: and yet i would be the one who got it, and despite it being rather lucky, i wouldn't be obligated to split it 100/75 with you<br />EP: correct<br />EP: except u sold the lottery ticket<br />EP: and then u found out u could cash it in<br />EP: for a bonus aamount<br />me: <br />EP: but the product isnt yours<br />EP: lol<br />EP: can u warranty a lost product?<br />me: that's true<br />me: so i ripped up my ticket<br />me: and you magically put it back together for me<br />me: hahahaha<br />EP: i guess u can say<br />EP: u ripped up ur ticket into a million pieces<br />EP: i found it on the ground and put it back together<br />EP: lol<br />EP: but <br />EP: thats such a bad analogy<br />EP: i dont even want to use it<br />me: true<br />me: this is why<br />me: it's bad to win the lotto<br />me: everyone you know<br />me: well, i shouldn't finish this analogy either:)<br />EP: lol<br />EP: under the limited warranty<br />EP: it says<br />EP: remedies<br />EP: logitech's entire liability....<br />EP: repair or replace<br />EP: ...<br />EP: PROVIDED<br />EP: that the hardware is RETURNED to the point of purchase<br />EP: i think that means u have to haev it<br />EP: lol<br />me: obviously they

right?<br />me: yes<br />EP: therefore<br />EP: half EV<br />EP: is we both net<br />EP: 88.50<br />EP: correct?<br />EP: from neutral ground<br />EP: correct?<br />EP: my speakers went -100 EV<br />EP: i add that -100 onto my 88.50<br />EP: correct?<br />EP: 188.50<br />EP: which is<br />EP: my money back<br />EP: 150<br />EP: +38.50<br />EP: yes?<br />EP: write in on paper<br />EP: im not wrong<br />me: oh, i agree this time<br />me: so you get<br />me: your money<br />me: $150<br />me: plus the old speakers<br />me: $50<br />EP: +38.50<br />me: and you pay me $12.50<br />EP: no<br />me: <br />EP: u pay me 38.50<br />EP: i dont pay u 12.50<br />me: but you said 188.50<br />EP: it is 188.50<br />EP: which is <br />EP: my money<br />EP: +38.50<br />me: and you get to keep the money, 150<br />me: oh, i seee<br />EP: right?<br />me: ok i agree<br />me: so i keep the new speakers, and the old speakers<br />EP: no<br />me: and you keep $150<br />me: and i pay you<br />EP: i get old speakers too<br />me: $38.50<br />EP: i get old ones too<br />me: the old speakers are $50<br />EP: yes<br />EP: do u remember how i got 188.50?<br />EP: god kalvin please take math<br />EP: 150 valuie on speaker i bought from u<br />EP: they DETIORARTED TO 50<br />EP: -100<br />EP: so i still HAVE the speakers<br />EP: 88.50+100<br />EP: is 188.50<br />EP: speakers in my possession<br />EP: u give me 150+38.50<br />EP: aw make more snese?<br />me: ah, yes<br />EP: see<br />EP: thats what i meant by<br />EP: the danger of lowering their cost<br />EP: too much<br />me: so you get free speakers, and $38<br />EP: ill take them<br />EP: yes<br />EP: thats why<br />me: and i get new speakers<br />EP: u need to put the cost<br />EP: yep<br />EP: isnt that 1/2 EV?<br />me: yep<br />me: so i could've gotten it warranteed on my own, easily<br />me: whereas you couldn't have<br />me: so since i did all the work<br />EP: lol<br />EP: back to square one?<br />me: yup<br />EP: see<br />EP: the problem here<br />EP: is NOT<br />EP: the fact<br />me: there's too many variables<br />EP: that u could have done everything<br />EP: etc.<br />EP: which did NOT take place<br />EP: and shouldnt even be considered<br />EP: no?<br />me: you're right<br />me: we shouldn't consider things<br />me: that didn't happen<br />me: we should consider<br />EP: lol<br />EP: o great<br />EP: now what<br />me: that did happen<br />me: such as<br />me: my getting new speakers<br />me::)<br />EP: lol<br />EP: its under my ownership tho<br />EP::: ure warrantying for me<br />EP: since ur names on teh receipts<br />EP: cuz ure warrantying MY product<br />EP: yea?<br />EP: so im awarding u half EV<br />EP: for warrantying<br />EP: FOR me<br />EP: u get it?<br />EP: lol<br />me: my warranty your product<br />me: got it<br />me: so if we split<br />me: we should split the profits<br />EP: yes<br />EP: even tho product outweighs warranty<br />EP: but sure<br />EP: lol<br />me: so you bought the 680's from me for 150, that exchange involved no profit since you are the owner of the broken 680's<br />EP: we should play more board games puzzle games with each other<br />me: as you pointed out<br />EP: yes<br />EP: that exchange is neutral EV<br />EP: go on<br />me: so now let's split the new speakers<br />me: they're worth 225<br />me: minimum<br />EP: lol<br />EP: no<br />EP: sorry<br />EP: u sold me<br />EP: WORKING speakers<br />EP: for 150<br />EP: not broken ones<br />EP: yea?<br />EP: u have the responsibility to replace them<br />EP: THEN we split<br />EP: the 225<br />EP: so buy me a new subwoof<br />EP: then we can split<br />EP: the 225ish<br />EP: see<br />EP: NOW all the factors are in<br />EP: &gt;)<br />me: that leaves me with 100% of the risk and responsibility and 50% of the reward<br />EP: waitwait<br />EP: when u sell a product<br />EP: and it breaks before first usage<br />EP: u have no risk<br />me: then you take it back<br />EP: but thats not what happened<br />me: since this is all hypothetical, you'd take it back<br />EP: why is any of this<br />EP: hypothetical<br />EP: besides the take it back<br />me: because what actually happened is, i got new speakers warranteed<br />me: what we're discussing is<br />EP: no<br />me: how much of those speakers are yours<br />EP: what actually happened<br />EP: is u used MY warranty<br />EP: to get new speakers<br />me: my warranty, your product<br />me: ok<br />EP: no<br />EP: product comes with warranty<br />EP: no?<br />EP: or ill buy warranty slip from u for additional 5 dollars<br />me: no<br />EP: or however much they sell for<br />me: did you read the manual<br />me: the warranty <br />EP: nontransferrable<br />me: is legally nontransferrable<br />EP: u have no product<br />EP: receipt etc<br />EP: is still mine<br />EP: i just cant warranty<br />me: right<br />EP: no?<br />me: correct, you can't warranty<br />EP: therefore u cant either<br />EP: and with a newfound solution<br />EP: i let u warranty<br />me: perhaps we should just donate the new speakers to charity<br />EP: and we split EV<br />EP: what is wrong<br />EP: with what im saying<br />EP: ure like<br />EP: repelling it so hard<br />EP: lol<br />EP: it makes logical<br />EP: and numerical sense<br />EP: doesnt it?<br />me: we both make sense<br />EP: u wont buy it<br />EP: no u dont!<br />EP: lol<br />me: you didn't need to let me warranty<br />EP: who sells a product<br />EP: without the warranty<br />me: haha<br />EP: honestly<br />me: everyone who sells speakers<br />me: apparently<br />EP: all parts<br />EP: come to me<br />EP: and even so<br />EP: YOU CANT WARRANTY<br />EP: lol<br />EP: but u still DID false advertise<br />EP: right?<br />EP: which ur repsonsibility<br />EP: to replace<br />me: yeah, so i'll refund your money <br />EP: and we split the BONUS<br />me: or replace it<br />EP: get it?<br />EP: ok<br />EP: u can refund me 150<br />EP: and split the 225<br />EP: thats fine with me<br />me: when i took the serial number, that was implicit acceptance of taking back the product to get a replacement<br />EP: or 275<br />EP: or whatever it is<br />EP: yes<br />EP: and as you left the door<br />EP: words from ur mouth<br />EP: were<br />EP: maybe we will get lucky<br />me: haha quite true<br />EP: and you can have the new one<br />EP: and id keep the old ones<br />EP: thats more than implicit<br />EP: so "yi yen wai ding"<br />EP: lol<br />EP: one phrase sets the pace?<br />EP: i cant think of a better translation<br />EP: so whats the problem here<br />EP: ure already getting whatever EV<br />EP: be happy<br />EP: lol<br />EP: we are both getting plus<br />EP: i dont understand why u think of things<br />EP: as what COULD have been<br />EP: just think of what it is<br />me: that's exactly<br />EP: and take half EV<br />me: what i'd say to you<br />me: haha<br />EP: but the new speakers u ordered<br />EP: dont belong to you!<br />EP: technically everything regarding the product<br />EP: belongs to me<br />me: except the warranty<br />EP: if u cant warranty for me<br />EP: that sucks<br />me: which i used<br />EP: but the warranty isnt yours<br />me: and logitech gave me<br />EP: and u cant use it<br />me: it is mine legally; you're right, i shouldn't be able to usee it<br />me: but logitech DID let me use it<br />EP: did u tell them?<br />me: that's why i think of it as what is<br />EP: that it was yours?<br />EP: the productu sold already?<br />EP: did u say the product was no longer in ur possession<br />me: he specifically said<br />me: "you can do whatever you want"<br />EP: that means<br />me: with the broken speakers<br />EP: theres implicit assumption<br />EP: that the old ones belong to you<br />me: no<br />EP: if you can do whatever u want <br />EP: yes<br />me: that they belonged to me<br />me: when they broke<br />me: which is what i called for<br />EP: lol<br />EP: no<br />EP: sorry<br />EP: things dont work that way<br />EP: they were broken<br />EP: and then i lost them<br />EP: im calling them in now<br />EP: for warranty<br />EP: sorry<br />EP: that doesnt work<br />EP: if u get third line me<br />me: yeah<br />EP: and ask logitech<br />EP: if that works<br />EP: fine<br />EP: but when u sell a product<br />me: so if instead<br />EP: YOU TOLD ME<br />me: i sold them tomorrow<br />EP: NOTHING ELSE<br />me: i'd be fine<br />EP: CAME WITH THE PRODUCT<br />EP: i asked u<br />EP: correct?<br />EP: therefore<br />EP: all items<br />EP: with the product<br />EP: are mine<br />me: except that legally the warranty can't be.<br />me: which, ok, is another misrepresentation of the product<br />EP: if the warranty cant legally be mine<br />EP: then u cant legally get a new set with out the product<br />me: this is going to make the top position on my im length list<br />me: i can feel it<br />EP: ure losing<br />EP: whichever way we look at it<br />EP: lol<br />EP: sorry<br />EP: lets get the facts in first<br />me: nope, logitech never made me verify<br />EP: then we can hypothetical all we want<br />EP: thats great<br />me: that i still had the speakers<br />me: since it's their discretion to do so<br />EP: but its part of the warranty thing<br />me: the warranty says<br />EP: no<br />EP: see<br />EP: tahts where ure wrong<br />EP: all things attached to the item<br />EP: are mine<br />EP: now<br />EP: i can not warranty<br />EP: anymore<br />EP: because u did<br />EP: i dont even have the option to try<br />EP: because ur serial

case<br />EP: but however we look at it<br />EP: the warranty<br />EP: is either mine<br />EP: or its noones<br />EP: it is NEVER<br />EP: yours<br />EP: u have no product<br />EP: thats fact<br />EP:

did<br />EP: third party ask<br />EP: and show me<br />EP: thats what i did<br />EP: cuz i didnt trust myself<br />EP: even tho i thought it was unfair<br />EP: reinforced learning yea?<br />EP: it would help ur arguements too<br />EP: if u got backing<br />EP: lol<br />me: i did<br />EP: please show<br />me: i did<br />EP: ?<br />EP: whod u ask<br />EP: u showed me noone<br />me: yes, i did<br />me: i pasted it<br />EP: no<br />EP: i must have dced then<br />EP: i never saw it<br />me: let me find it<br />EP: repaste<br />me: me: i think this was one of the best reasoned responses i got<br />me: x: i dont think that either of the arguments/ways to resolve the situation are the way to go<br />x: it seems to me that A wouldn't have known the speakers were broken unless B had purchased them and stuff<br />x: A could have sold them via ebay, and then dealt with an external unhappy 3rd party<br />x: so it seems B deserves some credit&nbsp; for finding the broken-ness<br />x: still, it seems to "cheat" A to say that B owns the speakers, the new ones, as without A, B probably wouldn't have been able to get a replacement<br />x: because of the receipts/orig. purchaser stuff<br />x: i would think that perhaps some monetary compromise is in order... if i were buying the speakers in question, i would find a $75 increase very hard to stomach<br /><br />EP: k<br />EP: well<br />EP: i told u that the old ones<br />EP: we missed a volume switch right?<br />me: k<br />EP: OO<br />EP: i thought x was YOU<br />me: no<br />EP: where are u showing me the wording<br />EP: of the question<br />EP: i showed YOU right?<br />me: k<br />me: me: i will not reveal who i in this scenario<br />me: so whatever you might think, don't reveal it<br />me: so person A&nbsp; buys speakers a little over a year ago<br />me: A uses them for a bit, then puts them into storage for several months <br />me: prior to being put into storage, they function perfectly<br />me: A finds a buyer, person B <br />me: person B purchases the speakers and finds that they have an unrepairable problem; one speaker is broken<br />me: despite A's assurances that the speakers worked fine<br />me: so B returns to A and informs him of the problem<br />me: A can't fix them and decides to try to get a replacement, promising to refund all the money paid if he fails<br />me: A calls the company and finds that they're still under warranty<br />me: since the company no longer carries that model, it provides a newer model <br />me: which it will ship to A's house, since A is the original purchaser and has the receipt<br />me: now, the question is, does A have the obligation to provide these new speakers to B at the same, substantially cheaper price as the original speakers<br />me: or is he only obligated to refund the money originally paid, since the speakers were faulty<br />me: discuss.<br />me: entirety.<br />EP: wtf<br />EP: is x ?<br />me: haha oh man<br />me: no<br />EP: really?<br />me: not even close.<br />EP: wow<br />EP: it sounds like her writing<br />EP: tone of voice<br />EP: but theres no periods at the end<br />EP: wow<br />EP: i dont know anyone that talks like that<br />me: so<br />me: ?<br />EP: ok<br />EP: so u left out something<br />EP: u keep the old ones<br />EP: u cant miss that<br />EP: lol<br />EP: if the old ones we send back<br />EP: then<br />EP: we have something to talk about<br />EP: cuz thats 50 EV<br />EP: and we have a 75 EV value difference<br />EP: and how many peopel did u ask<br />EP: cuz thats a big factor<br />EP: the old ones<br />EP: cuz u said that was one of the BETTER responses<br />me: the old ones don't matter; i refund your money and you give me back the old ones<br />me: that would not have affected his response in any way<br />EP: sure, but then we split the profit<br />me: read his response<br />me: i said that was one of the better reasoned responses<br />me: as opposed to one line "yes no"<br />EP: x: still, it seems to "cheat" A to say that B owns the speakers, the new ones, as without A, B probably wouldn't have been able to get a replacement<br />x: because of the receipts/orig. purchaser stuff<br />EP: yea?<br />EP: so B deserves some credit right?<br />me: yes<br />EP: isnt that what his entire arguement<br />EP: is implying<br />me: yes<br />EP: ?<br />EP: so what we are doing here<br />EP: is that you are giving me a replacement<br />me: so x advises<br />EP: for my old ones<br />EP: which is neutral EV<br />EP: and then as part of my credit<br />EP: we split EV<br />me: that we come to a monetary compromise<br />EP: because person x<br />EP: does not know<br />EP: u are reimbursing me<br />EP: for the other one<br />me: between the $225 i would like <br />EP: o wait<br />me: and the $150 you would like<br />EP: ure right then<br />EP: so basically<br />me: and you've already paid<br />EP: the other speakers<br />EP: are a tossout<br />me: no<br />EP: u owe me a product<br />EP: yes<br />EP: warranty<br />EP: they are gone<br />EP: you owe me another product<br />EP: by ur defintion<br />EP: it costs 75 more<br />EP: ill pay it<br />EP: i get both systems<br />me: yes, i owe you another product, and you owe me the original broken speakers<br />EP: why?<br />me: because when you return something for being broken<br />EP: not according to logitech huh?<br />me: the original seller has the right to demand the broken item in exchange for the replacement<br />me: no, not according to logitech<br />EP: well<br />EP: i guess<br />EP: i get to keep them?<br />EP: so anyways<br />EP: even if i werent<br />EP: where exactly<br />EP: is my monetary benefactory<br />EP: ?<br />EP: that was some bad english<br />me: hehe<br />EP: see<br />EP: this is why<br />EP: im willing to SPLIT<br />EP: the EV<br />me: i'm willing to split our differences<br />me: the way you calculate EV<br />EP: whats wrong wtih it<br />EP: its numbers<br />EP: cant be wrong<br />EP: lol<br />me: it presumes that i got nothing <br />me: basically<br />EP: because<br />me: because right now<br />EP: you DO HAVE NOTHING<br />EP: !?!?!<br />me: no<br />EP: u sold me<br />EP: the product<br />EP: and everything wtih it<br />EP: you HAVE NOTHING<br />EP: lol<br />me: i called logitech, and they gave me something<br />me: haha<br />EP: well its not meant for you<br />me: ahahahaha<br />EP: ok but

You hate me for making you scroll 9 times farther down your friends page? oh... sorry. O:))<br /><br />On another note, I always found the attitude of many Saratogans toward making money rather interesting. I remember many, many people saying that if I made a profit by selling a $20 item I had bought for $10 to someone for $15, then I was-- obviously!-- cheating their notions of fairness. Even if the buyer was happy to pay the $15, I was still ripping off the buyer. I spent my sophomore summer reselling goods on ebay, and the same summer listening to comments like "Oh, isn't that ripping people off?" Even now I find that some people still have those same notions-- money isn't money to them, it's simply a nice abstract concept that should be shared fairly and evenly, and God forbid someone profit more than the other from a mutually beneficial transaction! Gosh, now I feel like a sarcastic Republican... ew.<br /><br />Anyway.

The experimental literature found that physically attractive people were perceived as more sociable, dominant, sexually warm, mentally healthy, intelligent, and socially skilled than physically unattractive people. Yet, the correlational literature indicated generally trivial relationships between physical attractiveness and measures of personality and mental ability, although good-looking people were less lonely, less socially anxious, more popular, more socially skilled, and more sexually experienced than unattractive people.

Although an effect of target attractiveness on perceptions of sexual warmth was obtained for targets of both sexes, the effect size was significantly larger when the target was female.<br /><br />Feingold, Alan S-8 #2The meta-analysis of correlates of physical attractiveness indicated no notable relationships between physical attractiveness and basic personality traits (e.g., sociability, dominance, mental health) for subjects of either sex. Character-related traits (self-absorption, manipulativeness) were also unrelated to physical attractiveness. However, the personality traits related to social behavior?loneliness, social anxiety, self-consciousness?were related to physical attractiveness. For both sexes, good-looking people reported less loneliness and lower social anxiety (both in general and with regard to opposite sex interaction in particular) but greater public self-consciousness.<br /><br />Feingold, Alan S-8 #3Unsurprisingly, physical attractiveness was positively correlated with social behavior measures (social skills, popularity with the opposite sex, number of same-sex friends), but was only trivially related to cognitive ability measures (test scores, grades). Physically attractive women were more sexual permissive (as measured by attitude scales but not by behavioral reports) than were unattractive women. Finally, for both sexes, the physically attractive were found to have engaged in a greater variety of sexual activities (and, for women, at earlier ages) than did the unattractive, although this did not include having had more sexual partners.<br /><br />Feingold, Alan S-8 #4Self-rated physical attractiveness was positively and appreciably related to most of the attributes examined for both sexes: extraversion, mental health, self-esteem, social comfort, popularity with the opposite sex, and sexual experience. Public self-consciousness, character, social skills, and academic ability, however, were unrelated to self-judgments of attractiveness.<br /> Perpetuation of the Physical Attractiveness Stereotype<br /><br />Feingold, Alan S-8 #5Given that there are apparently few dispositional differences between physically attractive and physically unattractive people in the dimensions most strongly associated with the attractiveness stereotype (see Study 3), why does the stereotype exist? The stereotype may be fostered by (a) the entertainment media, (b) inability of perceivers to distinguish between states and traits (temporal extension; McArthur, 1982), and (c) inability of perceivers to distinguish between situational and dispositional causes of others' behaviors (the fundamental attribution error; Ross, 1977). <br /><br />Role of Temporal Extension<br /><br />Feingold, Alan S-8 #7 Snyder et al.'s (1977) behavioral confirmation study showed that physically attractive people may indeed behave more responsively in social interactions because of others' greater responsiveness toward them, but that does not mean that there are differences in the trait of sociability between attractive and unattractive people. By temporal extension, however, people make dispositional inferences from state behaviors (McArthur, 1982). Thus, perceivers may observe a genuine correlation between physical attractiveness and transient aspects of sociability (affected by others' behaviors toward them) and infer an illusory correlation between physical attractiveness and dispositional sociability (defined as differences in need for affiliation).<br /><br />Role of the Fundamental Attribution Error<br /><br />Feingold, Alan S-8 #8The fundamental attribution error, which occurs when observers make dispositional attributions for situationally determined behaviors (Ross, 1977), may maintain the attractiveness stereotype in two ways. First, people may erroneously ascribe different traits to the physically attractive and physically unattractive on the basis of observed behavioral differences that are evoked by situational factors, namely, the differential treatment afforded them. Second, people may infer others' traits from life-outcome variables, such as dating frequency and party-going behavior. Yet such outcome variables are strongly determined by situational factors (e.g., number of party and date invitations) that are affected by people's physical attractiveness. <br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Physical attractiveness can be viewed as a status characteristic, along with intelligence, charm, humor, athletic ability, and other socially valued characteristics (Kalick, 1988; Webster & Driskell, 1983). It might be preferable, therefore, to cease the study of physical attractiveness in isolation and instead focus on the joint effects of physical attractiveness and other status characteristics, both on person perception and on social success, academic achievement, and life satisfaction.<br />";s:7:"summary";s:7407:"See commentary in the follow-up (friended) entry.<br /><br />"Writer Nicholas Bakalar reports in Ugly Children May Get Parental Short Shrift that, in a nutshell, you could give a shit what happens to your homely children."<br /><a href="http://youcantmakeitup.blogspot.com/2005/05/face-not-even-your-mother-could-love.html" target="_blank">http://youcantmakeitup.blogspot.com/2005/0<wbr />5/face-not-even-your-mother-could-love.h<wbr />tml</a><br /><br />My Life as a Thin Person<br />People like Lisa Marie Sohr, who lose 100 pounds or more with stomach surgery, find that with their new bodies often come new friends, new spouses, new lives.

I call it the most fun I've ever had writing an academic paper. So, I analyzed this three-sentence post-it note that was stuck to some girl's printer, in the format of a five-page essay...<br /><br /><center><b>POST-IT PERSUASION</b><br /><br /><i>ATTENTION: <br />There are other printers in this world?<br />Be kind and don?t always pick on mine :)</i></center><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Post-It Notes and notes in general fulfill a common need for quick written communication. The usually hurried nature of a note, however, doesn?t preclude a complexity equal to an essay. In a sticky situation involving an aquarium and curious children, a writer may favor a more direct approach such as ?Do not touch the glass!?, or an indirect approach such as ?The fish don?t like fingerprints!? Those written for the indeterminate many require more thought on the part of the writer than those written for a specific person. Whereas the writer of the latter only needs to focus on the reactions of one person, the writer of the former must craft the note to elicit the intended response in many different people. In this note, the writer alternates the direct rhetoric of command with indirect, suggestive rhetoric to accomplish twin goals. She both deters readers from using the printer and avoids offending those readers; indeed, she improves the reader?s perception of the writer. By implying that the reader may be responsible for previous abuses of the printer, the writer puts the reader on the defensive while avoiding the offensive nature of an explicit accusation. Like a child playing ?now-you-see-me-now-you-don?t,? this peek-a-boo rhetoric?now direct, now indirect?allows the writer to craft her note for maximum effect.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="cutid1"></a>The writer must grab the reader?s attention before beginning her first goal of deterring others from using the printer. The first line, ?ATTENTION,? does this in a direct manner: as the only word on the note in capital letters, and the only word to occupy its own line, it clearly stands out. Putting capital letters on a short note is the written equivalent of yelling in a small room; everyone notices. Line breaks add emphasis to statements, and the line break after a single word indicates the writer wants extra ?ATTENTION? paid. These two factors signal to the reader the seriousness and urgency of the note, and the reader may almost mentally brace for what comes next. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet the writer immediately breaks this tone in the second line, shifting from straightforward to suggestive. ?There are other printers in this world?? Had the writer ended the sentence with a period, it would have become curt, even rude, with the unspoken resentment of ?Why are you using my printer?? following thereafter. Instead, by ending the sentence with an ellipsis, the writer imbues it with a sense of incompleteness that invites the reader to complete the thought independently with a logical conclusion: that perhaps this particular printer is not meant for the reader?the reader should find ?other printers? instead. Though either method achieves the same results, the latter allows a reader to believe it arrived through natural though processes, instead of by command. Every parent of an obstinate toddler (or teenager) knows this. It makes a world of difference when someone does something of their own volition, such as pick up socks, instead of being forced to pick up socks by an authority figure. The picker-upper is both more likely to pick up the socks as well as more likely to be happy and not resentful of the authority figure. In the context of the note, the writer uses indirect rhetoric, the power of suggestion, to avoid becoming a resented authority figure in the process of getting the reader to pick another printer.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The next line, by contrast, begins with a firm statement: ?Be kind?? Here the writer catches the reader off-guard. The reader has just finished reading a line which does not confront the reader in any way and required some thought to deduce the writer?s thoughts. Now, the writer commands. She omits modifiers such as ?Please? or ?Try to? that would have lessened the harshness, so the reader must assume the writer intends the admonishing tone. The reader must also assume that the writer finds it necessary for some unknown reason to remind the reader to be kind; this may cause the reader to try harder to be kind in order to avoid proving the writer correct. Though the writer has not specified yet how one should ?be kind,? the previous line and the context of the note?s location on a printer provide ample clues that using one of the ?other printers in this world? would be kind, i.e. not using the writer?s printer. The reader also knows that printing requires ink and paper, consumable resources paid for by the printer?s owner, the note-writer. This should confirm the reader?s suspicion that the writer views the act of printing as unkind because it costs the writer money. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then the writer switches back to implication with ?and don?t always pick on mine.? This ending contains the note?s richest rhetoric, with three discrete sections working together. In the first section, the writer?s use of ?always? in ?always pick on? strongly implies the reader has, in the past, picked on the printer. The writer, however, has not told the reader to completely stop picking on the printer, but rather to not always pick on the printer. This implies that the writer can endure some level of usage (i.e., abuse) of her printer?and by extension is a good person?but the reader has exceeded the threshold of tolerance. This adds to the burden of guilt that the writer implies the reader should carry. In the second section, the writer?s use of the term ?pick on? to refer to the readers? possible use of the printer compares the reader?s potential use of the printer to the act of a bully taking advantage of a defenseless victim. Equating usage of the printer to abuse of the printer certainly acts as a strong incentive to the reader not to use the printer. Third, the writer calls the printer ?mine,? stating ownership. More subtly, the writer also self-identifies with the printer. Thus, any injury received by the printer seems to injure the writer as well; this makes the reader even more wary, since abusing a person ranks worse than abusing inanimate objects. Already off-balance because of the writer?s flip-flopping between direct and indirect persuasion, the third sentence as a whole puts the reader firmly into the defensive position of proving he or she is not unkind?i.e., into the position of not using the printer.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, the writer concludes with a small smiley face. The writer uses this all-purpose smiley face like a warm smile in real life, in an attempt to smooth over any remaining concerns she might have about how the reader will respond to the note. Perhaps up to this point the reader found the note too strongly worded, bordering on rude. Despite the writer?s best efforts to keep it inoffensive, the reader still feels the writer made unwarranted accusations. In that case, like a grin, the smiley face tells the reader not to take the note too seriously; the writer means well and does not mean to offend. Or, the reader might have been annoyed by the overly indirect presentation of the note?s message; perhaps he or she had taken a rhetoric course and felt almost manipulated by the perceived rhetoric within the note. In that case, the smiley face, like a wink and a quick smile, can tell the reader that the writer secretly sympathizes with the reader but introduced the hybrid direct/indirect tone as a persuasive technique for lesser readers. The smiley face softens any sharp edges the reader may have found in the note, regardless of what those sharp edges might have been, simply because it seems to the reader like a personal, and personalized, expression of some sort of positive emotion from the writer. The reader may not know of what sort exactly, but cannot receive it without a feeling of general gratitude. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus concludes the note. Its writer demonstrates a command of both the direct and indirect approaches to note-writing. While a note with only direct rhetoric might have read ?Don?t use my printer!? and an indirect one ?There are other printers in this world??, neither has the effect of this note. ?Don?t use my printer!? risks offending the reader, while ?There are other printers in this world?? risks not getting the point across. Avoiding these inadequacies, the writer accomplishes admirably the goal of deterring others from using the printer. Though it may not stop the completely shameless, complete prevention does not appear to be the note?s purpose. The writer simply doesn?t want her printer to be used without a second thought, and it is unlikely anyone who viewed this note on her printer would not give using it a second shameful thought.

I call it the most fun I've ever had writing an academic paper. So, I analyzed this three-sentence post-it note that was stuck to some girl's printer, in the format of a five-page essay...<br /><br /><center><b>POST-IT PERSUASION</b><br /><br /><i>ATTENTION: <br />There are other printers in this world?<br />Be kind and don?t always pick on mine :)</i></center><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Post-It Notes and notes in general fulfill a common need for quick written communication. The usually hurried nature of a note, however, doesn?t preclude a complexity equal to an essay. In a sticky situation involving an aquarium and curious children, a writer may favor a more direct approach such as ?Do not touch the glass!?, or an indirect approach such as ?The fish don?t like fingerprints!? Those written for the indeterminate many require more thought on the part of the writer than those written for a specific person. Whereas the writer of the latter only needs to focus on the reactions of one person, the writer of the former must craft the note to elicit the intended response in many different people. In this note, the writer alternates the direct rhetoric of command with indirect, suggestive rhetoric to accomplish twin goals. She both deters readers from using the printer and avoids offending those readers; indeed, she improves the reader?s perception of the writer. By implying that the reader may be responsible for previous abuses of the printer, the writer puts the reader on the defensive while avoiding the offensive nature of an explicit accusation. Like a child playing ?now-you-see-me-now-you-don?t,? this peek-a-boo rhetoric?now direct, now indirect?allows the writer to craft her note for maximum effect.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="cutid1"></a>The writer must grab the reader?s attention before beginning her first goal of deterring others from using the printer. The first line, ?ATTENTION,? does this in a direct manner: as the only word on the note in capital letters, and the only word to occupy its own line, it clearly stands out. Putting capital letters on a short note is the written equivalent of yelling in a small room; everyone notices. Line breaks add emphasis to statements, and the line break after a single word indicates the writer wants extra ?ATTENTION? paid. These two factors signal to the reader the seriousness and urgency of the note, and the reader may almost mentally brace for what comes next. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet the writer immediately breaks this tone in the second line, shifting from straightforward to suggestive. ?There are other printers in this world?? Had the writer ended the sentence with a period, it would have become curt, even rude, with the unspoken resentment of ?Why are you using my printer?? following thereafter. Instead, by ending the sentence with an ellipsis, the writer imbues it with a sense of incompleteness that invites the reader to complete the thought independently with a logical conclusion: that perhaps this particular printer is not meant for the reader?the reader should find ?other printers? instead. Though either method achieves the same results, the latter allows a reader to believe it arrived through natural though processes, instead of by command. Every parent of an obstinate toddler (or teenager) knows this. It makes a world of difference when someone does something of their own volition, such as pick up socks, instead of being forced to pick up socks by an authority figure. The picker-upper is both more likely to pick up the socks as well as more likely to be happy and not resentful of the authority figure. In the context of the note, the writer uses indirect rhetoric, the power of suggestion, to avoid becoming a resented authority figure in the process of getting the reader to pick another printer.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The next line, by contrast, begins with a firm statement: ?Be kind?? Here the writer catches the reader off-guard. The reader has just finished reading a line which does not confront the reader in any way and required some thought to deduce the writer?s thoughts. Now, the writer commands. She omits modifiers such as ?Please? or ?Try to? that would have lessened the harshness, so the reader must assume the writer intends the admonishing tone. The reader must also assume that the writer finds it necessary for some unknown reason to remind the reader to be kind; this may cause the reader to try harder to be kind in order to avoid proving the writer correct. Though the writer has not specified yet how one should ?be kind,? the previous line and the context of the note?s location on a printer provide ample clues that using one of the ?other printers in this world? would be kind, i.e. not using the writer?s printer. The reader also knows that printing requires ink and paper, consumable resources paid for by the printer?s owner, the note-writer. This should confirm the reader?s suspicion that the writer views the act of printing as unkind because it costs the writer money. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then the writer switches back to implication with ?and don?t always pick on mine.? This ending contains the note?s richest rhetoric, with three discrete sections working together. In the first section, the writer?s use of ?always? in ?always pick on? strongly implies the reader has, in the past, picked on the printer. The writer, however, has not told the reader to completely stop picking on the printer, but rather to not always pick on the printer. This implies that the writer can endure some level of usage (i.e., abuse) of her printer?and by extension is a good person?but the reader has exceeded the threshold of tolerance. This adds to the burden of guilt that the writer implies the reader should carry. In the second section, the writer?s use of the term ?pick on? to refer to the readers? possible use of the printer compares the reader?s potential use of the printer to the act of a bully taking advantage of a defenseless victim. Equating usage of the printer to abuse of the printer certainly acts as a strong incentive to the reader not to use the printer. Third, the writer calls the printer ?mine,? stating ownership. More subtly, the writer also self-identifies with the printer. Thus, any injury received by the printer seems to injure the writer as well; this makes the reader even more wary, since abusing a person ranks worse than abusing inanimate objects. Already off-balance because of the writer?s flip-flopping between direct and indirect persuasion, the third sentence as a whole puts the reader firmly into the defensive position of proving he or she is not unkind?i.e., into the position of not using the printer.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, the writer concludes with a small smiley face. The writer uses this all-purpose smiley face like a warm smile in real life, in an attempt to smooth over any remaining concerns she might have about how the reader will respond to the note. Perhaps up to this point the reader found the note too strongly worded, bordering on rude. Despite the writer?s best efforts to keep it inoffensive, the reader still feels the writer made unwarranted accusations. In that case, like a grin, the smiley face tells the reader not to take the note too seriously; the writer means well and does not mean to offend. Or, the reader might have been annoyed by the overly indirect presentation of the note?s message; perhaps he or she had taken a rhetoric course and felt almost manipulated by the perceived rhetoric within the note. In that case, the smiley face, like a wink and a quick smile, can tell the reader that the writer secretly sympathizes with the reader but introduced the hybrid direct/indirect tone as a persuasive technique for lesser readers. The smiley face softens any sharp edges the reader may have found in the note, regardless of what those sharp edges might have been, simply because it seems to the reader like a personal, and personalized, expression of some sort of positive emotion from the writer. The reader may not know of what sort exactly, but cannot receive it without a feeling of general gratitude. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus concludes the note. Its writer demonstrates a command of both the direct and indirect approaches to note-writing. While a note with only direct rhetoric might have read ?Don?t use my printer!? and an indirect one ?There are other printers in this world??, neither has the effect of this note. ?Don?t use my printer!? risks offending the reader, while ?There are other printers in this world?? risks not getting the point across. Avoiding these inadequacies, the writer accomplishes admirably the goal of deterring others from using the printer. Though it may not stop the completely shameless, complete prevention does not appear to be the note?s purpose. The writer simply doesn?t want her printer to be used without a second thought, and it is unlikely anyone who viewed this note on her printer would not give using it a second shameful thought. They wouldn?t blame her for the shame, either.<br /><br /><center>***********</center><br />mmm... I miss those days of endless poetry revisions. hey remember sutton in english 9?

Perhaps not on par with Harvard's, but... so student orgs here write letters to alumni who have donated lots of money, and in exchange the orgs get $15 per letter. Well, this isn't so bad. It's just a nice personal thankyou note. Ah, but it's not. Not even officially.<br /><br />If you're lucky: Only a few people, usually the heads of the org, actually write a letter. Then the letter is copied (by hand of course) by the members... 8 times by 8 different members. Each member can copy more than one head's letter, too-- so if there are 4 heads, and they each write a letter, then each of the 16 members can each copy 2 letters, creating 32 "hand-written" personal letters, and receiving $930 (in theory; in reality it's less because of rejected letters). Oh, and this happens every quarter. <br /><br />If you're not so lucky (Ada): You write a letter. You copy it by hand 8 times. Your org's 50 members generate 400 letters, netting it $6000.<br /><br />If you're really not so lucky: Repeat for different orgs that you're in.<br /><br />***********************************<br /><br />Dear ______,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My name is [my name].

Many surveys lead us down that path. In study after study on national happiness levels, my country, the Philippines, gets unlikely top scores.

We Filipinos live in a country mired in poverty, political conflict, corruption and environmental destruction. On top of that, the Philippines is so regularly battered by typhoons, earthquakes, landslides, floods, volcanic eruptions and other natural catastrophes that it's been ranked the world's most disaster-prone nation by the Brussels-based Center for Research and Epidemiology of Disasters.

We're happiest in a group: family, friends, immediate community, even strangers. I've seen it happen in many airports among perfect strangers: as soon as Philippine travelers drift in, they gravitate toward one another and soon form a boisterous crowd, exchanging jokes and mobile-phone numbers. The awesome range of peculiar Philippine nicknames, a source of amusement to foreigners, are tokens of how much such social groups mean to people: the nicknames are bestowed by family and friends. Some Filipinos use a string of them over the years.<br /><br />The small group is our bastion against life's unfairness. Hundreds of years of bad government have taught us to expect little from impersonal institutions. We know that our leaders are corrupt, that our country is marred by inequality, that there's plenty of injustice. We just try not to let it get in the way of enjoying life.
